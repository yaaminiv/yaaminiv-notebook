## Today's hilarious labwork fail

With the Thermomixer I borrowed from Genome Sciences, I was ready to test the [PAXgene Tissue DNA Kit](https://www.preanalytix.com/sites/default/files/handbooks/HB-0162-003-1080354-HB%20PAXgene%20Tissue%20DNA%201214%20WW.pdf) with one of my pre-treatment samples!

I first grabbed the histology block with 5 notches from the storage container. Note to self: wiggle the drawer as you pull it open! The histology blocks tend to get stuck.

Once I had the block, I needed to scrape no more than 20 mg, or 0.02 g of tissue out.

I transferred the tissue from the weigh boat to a 2 mL tube. The next step was to add 1 mL of xylene to my sample. We usually use the Young lab's xylene, so I went over to their fume hood. However, the only xylene bottle they had was actually a xylene waste bottle! I probably should have checked this myself instead of going from Sam's word...whoops. Sam's now ordering xylene, and I'll have to put this process on hold once more.
