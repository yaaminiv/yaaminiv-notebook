## [Insert something witty about March Madness]

### [February Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/February-2018-Goals/):

- I made progress on my [DNR paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1giP16iXWPE7oDSNI7fyLV3p_1jqsXuuxlH7cJQAwhLM/edit#heading=h.7vvlns7jaib)! I now have a [solid figure](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Remaining-Analyses-Part20/), and relatively complete methods and results sections.
- Started putting things in my [paper repository](https://github.com/RobertsLab/paper-gigas-DNR-proteomics). I haven't sorted through anything, but most of what I think will be important is there.
- [Analyzed my reproductive output data](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Reproductive-Output-Analyses/). While there was no difference in egg production between females exposed to the different pH treatments, there was a significant difference in hatch rates. Any cross with a female exposed to low pH had a significantly lower hatch rate.
- Decided not to start any labwork with the *C. gigas* histology samples just yet. If we find something interesting int he *C. virginica* gonad samples, then we can think about the *C. gigas* gonad samples.
- Met with Tim to discuss the best way to analyze my gonad histology data. We started an [R Script](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-oyster-oa/blob/master/analyses/Manchester_Gonad_Histology/2018-02-27-Histology-Classification-Analyses.R) with a binomial glm that I'll modify in the near future.
- Wrapped up the *C. virginica* labwork!
- Updated my section of the [People page](http://faculty.washington.edu/sr320/?page_id=505). It now includes my research interests, other interests, reasons to contact me, and my contact information!

### March Goals:

**DNR**:

- Write my discussion, introduction and abstract (i.e. finish the paper)
- Finalize paper repository contents and supplemental information section
- Send draft to Alex and Micah (after Steven, Emma and Brent give the all-clear)

**Manchester**:

- Finish analyzing gonad histology data
- Analyze larval mortality data
- Put together my NSA presentation!

**Virginica**:

- Set up *C. viriginica* data analysis pipeline using oil spill samples

**Metaanalysis**:

- Read papers
- Draft introduction

**Other**:

- Schedule time every day to read at least one paper. I hate reading, but I need to do it! It'll be my version of #MarchMadness.
- Come up with broad project ideas for my next chapter. Current ideas include incorporating "-omics" data into climate change predictions (Ã  la Dr. Rachel Bay),  examining epigenetic signatures of marine invasions AND climate-related stressors, and/or doing more work outside of controlled hatchery and lab settings. Reading *should* help with this.
