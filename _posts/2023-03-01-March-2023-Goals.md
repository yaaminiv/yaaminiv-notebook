Hi. It's been a while since I wrote some concrete goals! But seeing how this is my last month on my WHOI Postdoctoral Scholarship before I transition to the NSF PRFB, I thought it would be good to assess the status of my current projects and do some prioritizing.

### [December Goals + the first bit of 2023 recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/December-2022-Goals/)

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

- Solidified OrthoFinder methods
- Got results from the OrthoFinder analysis!
- Worked on HRE analysis
- Updated methods and results in paper

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- [Continued working with Sara on demographic data analysis](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-Part14/)
- Paused this to devote my full attention to the coral project

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

- Restructured paper to reflect a move back to `methylKit`
- Sam extracted SNPs with `EpiDiverse`, but I haven't looked at the output

**Virginica Methylation and Expression**:

- Revisited transcriptional noise analysis

**Other**:

- Launched the postdoc mentoring program!
- I haven't distributed the postdoc mentoring survey results, but I'll have the next set of PDA representatives do that
- Started applying mindful productivity tenets to my working habits

### March Goals

My main focus for March is to get the coral project in a place where I can shift to writing. This means having all analyses completed, methods and results written, and an outlined discussion. My goals reflect this priority!

**Coral Transcritomics**:

- Finish remaining analyses
- Update methods
- Update results
- Outline discussion
- Get Ann or Maggie to provide comments on materials written

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

- Add Rajan's edits as comments to the draft manuscript
- Review `EpiDiverse` output and create a new SNP list
- Rerun `methylKit`
- Conduct a randomization test for DML identification
- Update methods and results

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- Determine workflow for metabolomics sample processing
- Order materials for metabolomics samples
- Finish demographic data analysis
- Update methods and results

**Virginica Methylation and Expression**:

- Update results with initial `mixOmics` analysis
- Revise gene-based transcriptional noise model
- Create sample-based transcriptional noise model
- Look into spurious transcription methods
- Create a SNP list from `EpiDiverse` output

**Other**:

- NSF PRFB start paperwork
- Eelgrass transcriptomics reviewer comments
- Module 1 of mindful productivity for scientists class

### Deep Freeze

Things that are not immediate enough to be on the backburner, so they're stuck in the deep freeze.

**Killifish Methylation and Expression**:

I'll return to this when I have a good draft of the coral paper.

- Pathway analysis for RNA-Seq data
- Determine protocol for SNP identification
- Conduct in silico RRBS digestion
- Characterize DEG that overlap between populations
- Quantify gene expression variability
- Visualize DEG data

**Zebrafish DNMT**:

I'll think about this once I have a robust killifish paper draft.

- Identify a stress condition to use for the zebrafish based on disease factors or conditions that are known to induce changes in methylation
- Determine physiological endpoints to assess for embryos
- Construct a project timeline
