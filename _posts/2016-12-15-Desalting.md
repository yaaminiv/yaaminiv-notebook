## Not Salty about Desalting

Our final day of protein extractions! :tada: After a late night (or early morning) using the [speed vacuum](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Speed-Vacuum/) yesterday, I am not at all sad, salty or mad about wrapping this baby up :joy:

Desalting allows us to isolate the peptides in our samples and prepare them for Mass Spectrometry. 

#### **Materials required**:
Reagents were made by Rhonda using the [following protocol](https://github.com/sr320/LabDocs/blob/master/protocols/ProteinprepforMSMS.md).

- Solvent A = 60% acetonitrile + 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (300ul/sample)
- Solvent B = 5% acetonitrile + 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (500ul/sample)
- Final Solvent = 3% acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid (100ul/sample)
- 10% formic acid
- Macrospin columns (Sample capacity: 0.03-300ug, Elution volume 50-150ul, Bed volume 300ul)
 - 2 sets of 11 each, labelled
- Snaptop centrifuge tubes
 - 2 sets of 11 each, labelled
 
#### **Sample reconstitution**:
- Add 100 µL Solvent B to each sample
- For 1-2 samples, do the following
 - Test to see if sample is at pH 2
 - If not, add 10 µL 10% formic acid
 - Test pH again
 - Keep adding 10% formic acid in 10 µL increments until sample is at pH 2
- Based on the amount of formic acid to the 1-2 test samples, add formic acid to the rest of the samples
- Check pH of all samples

#### **Wash columns**:
- Take 1 set of 11 Marcospin columns
- Add 200 µL of Solvent A to each column
- Spin columns for 3 minutes at 2000 rpm
 - Repeat 3 more times
 - Discard remaining liquid in column every other spin to accomodate additional liquid

#### **Equilibrate columns**:
- Add 200 µL of Solvent B to each column
- Spin columns for 3 minutes at 2000 rpm
 - Repeat 3 more times
 - Discard remaining liquid in column every other spin to accomodate additional liquid

#### **Load protein on columns**:
- Add 30 µg of protein to each column
- Spin columns for 3 minutes at 3000 rpm
 - **Peptides are now in the columns**
- Transfer remaining liquid to the first set of previously labelled snaptop centrifuge tubes
- Store snaptop centrifuge tubes in -80ºC freezer

#### **Wash salts through columns**:
- Add 200 µL of Solvent B to each column
- Spin columns for 3 minutes at 3000 rpm
 - Repeat 2 more times
- Transfer remaining liquid to the second set of previously labelled snaptop centrifuge tubes
- Store snaptop centrifuge tubes in -80ºC freezer

#### **Elute peptides**:
- Transfer column contents to the second set of previously labelled Macrospin columns
- Add 100 µL of Solvent A to each column
- Spin columns for 3 minutes at 3000 rpm
 - Repeat 1 more time
 - **Peptides are now in the liquid**
- Transfer remaining liquid to the second set of previously labelled snaptop centrifuge tubes

#### **Evaporate peptides**:
- Using speed vacuum, evaporate samples to near dryness at 4ºC

#### **Reconsitute peptides**:
- Add 100 µL of final solvent to each column
- Lighty vortex all samples
- Centrifuge all samples down
- Store samples in -80ºC freezer

We're done with extractions! We'll load these samples on the Mass Spectrometer in late January.
