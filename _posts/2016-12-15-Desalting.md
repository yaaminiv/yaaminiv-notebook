## Not Salty about Desalting

Our final day of protein extractions! :tada: After a late night (or early morning) using the [speed vacuum](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Speed-Vacuum/) yesterday, I am not at all sad, salty or mad about wrapping this baby up :joy:

Desalting allows us to isolate the peptides in our samples and prepare them for Mass Spectrometry. 

#### **Materials required**:
Reagents were made by Rhonda using the [following protocol](https://github.com/sr320/LabDocs/blob/master/protocols/ProteinprepforMSMS.md).

- Solvent A = 60% acetonitrile + 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (300ul/sample)
- Solvent B = 5% acetonitrile + 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (500ul/sample)
- Final Solvent = 3% acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid (100ul/sample)
- 10% formic acid
- Macrospin columns (Sample capacity: 0.03-300ug, Elution volume 50-150ul, Bed volume 300ul)
 - 2 sets of 11 each, labelled
- Snaptop centrifuge tubes
 - 2 sets of 11 each, labelled
 
#### **Sample reconstitution**:
- Add 100 µL Solvent B to each sample
- For 1-2 samples, do the following
 - Test to see if sample is at pH 2
 - If not, add 10 µL 10% formic acid
 - Test pH again
 - Keep adding 10% formic acid in 10 µL increments until sample is at pH 2
- Based on the amount of formic acid to the 1-2 test samples, add formic acid to the rest of the samples
- Check pH of all samples

![pH strips](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yaaminiv/yaaminiv.github.io/master/images/pHstripsformicacid.jpg)
**Figure 1.** pH test strips for all samples. With the exception of O124, I added 150 µL of 10% formic acid to each sample. I added 180 µL of 10% formic acid to O124.

#### **Wash columns**:
- Take 1 set of 11 Marcospin columns
- Add 200 µL of Solvent A to each column
- Spin columns for 3 minutes at 2000 rpm
 - Repeat 3 more times for a total for 4 spins
 - Discard remaining liquid in column every other spin to accomodate additional liquid

#### **Equilibrate columns**:
- Add 200 µL of Solvent B to each column
- Spin columns for 3 minutes at 2000 rpm
 - Repeat 2 more times for a total of 3 spins
 - Discard remaining liquid in column every other spin to accomodate additional liquid

#### **Load protein on columns**:
- Add 30 µg of protein digest to each column
- Spin columns for 3 minutes at 3000 rpm
- Collect flow-through, put back on column and spin again
 - **Peptides are now in the columns**
- Transfer remaining liquid to the first set of previously labelled snaptop centrifuge tubes
- Store snaptop centrifuge tubes in -80ºC freezer

#### **Wash salts through columns**:
- Add 200 µL of Solvent B to each column
- Spin columns for 3 minutes at 3000 rpm
 - Repeat 2 more times for a total of 3 spins
- Transfer remaining liquid to the second set of previously labelled snaptop centrifuge tubes
- Store snaptop centrifuge tubes in -80ºC freezer

#### **Elute peptides**:
- Transfer column contents to the second set of previously labelled Macrospin columns
- Add 100 µL of Solvent A to each column
- Spin columns for 3 minutes at 3000 rpm
 - Repeat 1 more time for a total of 2 spins
 - **Peptides are now in the liquid**
- Dispose of columns and keep collection tubes with liquid

#### **Evaporate peptides**:
- Using speed vacuum, evaporate samples to near dryness at 4ºC
 - Because someone else was using the speed vacuum when we arrived at the Genome Sciences building, we compromised and ran our samples with theirs at 8ºC.
- Speed vacuum start time: 4 p.m.

**Table 1**. Times samples were removed from speed vacuum. Samples were loaded at 4 p.m. at a temperature of 8ºC with refrigeration.

| **Sample** | **Time Removed from Speed Vacuum** |
|:----------:|:----------------------------------:|
|     O07    |              2:10 a.m.             |
|     O15    |              2:39 a.m.             |
|     O37    |              1:41 a.m.             |
|     O47    |              2:10 a.m.             |
|     O55    |              2:39 a.m.             |
|     O77    |              2:39 a.m.             |
|    O107    |              1:41 a.m.             |
|    O119    |              1:41 a.m.             |
|    O124    |             10:00 p.m.             |
|    O142    |              2:39 a.m.             |
|   OBLANK   |              2:53 a.m.             |

#### **Reconsitute peptides**:
- Add 100 µL of final solvent to each column
- Lighty vortex all samples
- Centrifuge all samples down
- Store samples in -80ºC freezer

We're done with extractions! We'll load these samples on the Mass Spectrometer in late January.
