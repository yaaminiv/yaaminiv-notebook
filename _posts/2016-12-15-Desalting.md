## Not Salty about Desalting

Our final day of protein extractions! :tada: After a late night (or early morning) using the [speed vacuum](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Speed-Vacuum/) yesterday, I am not at all sad, salty or mad about wrapping this baby up :joy:

Desalting allows us to isolate the peptides in our samples and prepare them for Mass Spectrometry. 

#### **Materials required**:
Reagents were made by Rhonda using the [following protocol](https://github.com/sr320/LabDocs/blob/master/protocols/ProteinprepforMSMS.md).

- Solvent A = 60% acetonitrile + 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (300ul/sample)
- Solvent B = 5% acetonitrile + 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (500ul/sample)
- Final Solvent = 3% acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid (100ul/sample)
- 10% formic acid
- Macrospin columns (Sample capacity: 0.03-300ug, Elution volume 50-150ul, Bed volume 300ul)
 - 2 sets of 11 each, labelled
- Snaptop centrifuge tubes
 - 2 sets of 11 each, labelled
 
#### **Sample reconstitution**:
- Added 100 µL Solvent B to each sample
- For 1-2 samples, did the following
 - Tested to see if sample is at pH 2
 - If not, added 10-20 µL 10% formic acid
 - Vortexed sample lightly to thoroughly mix solution
 - Tested pH again
 - Kept adding 10% formic acid in 10 µL increments until sample is at pH 2
 - Added 180 µL of 10% formic acid to sample O124
- Based on the amount of formic acid to the 1-2 test samples, added formic acid to the rest of the samples
 - Added 100 µL of 10% formic acid to sample O55 and tested pH
 - Added an extra 50 µL of 10% formic acid to O55 and tested pH
  - pH was at 2 units
  - Decided to add only 150 µL 10% formic acid to remaining samples
- Checked pH of all samples

**Figure 1.** pH test strips for all samples. With the exception of O124, I added 150 µL of 10% formic acid to each sample. I added 180 µL of 10% formic acid to O124. *Note: "O124" should read "O127"*

#### **Wash columns**:
- Took 1 set of 11 Marcospin columns
 - Removed caps from top and bottom of columns
 - Placed columns in set of collection tubes labelled "A"
- Added 200 µL of Solvent A to each column
- Spun columns for 3 minutes at 2000 rpm
 - Repeated 3 more times for a total for 4 spins
 - Discarded remaining liquid in column every other spin to accomodate additional liquid

#### **Equilibrate columns**:
- Added 200 µL of Solvent B to each column
- Spun columns for 3 minutes at 2000 rpm
* - Repeated 2 more times for a total of 3 spins
 - Discarded remaining liquid in column after the second and third spin to accomodate additional liquid

#### **Load protein on columns**:
- Vortexed samples with protein digest once more to thoroughly mix solution
- Added 30 µg of protein digest to each column
 - Pipetted total volume of liquid in sample snaptop centrifuge tube into the associated column
 - ex. "O07 MT" (snaptop centrifuge tube with protein digest) --> "O07 A" (collection tube with column)
- Spun columns for 3 minutes at 3000 rpm
- Pipetted liquid that flowed through column
- Put flow-through back on column
- Spun columns again for 3 minutes at 3000 rpm
 - **Peptides are now in the columns**
- Transfered remaining liquid to the first set of previously labelled snaptop centrifuge tubes
 - ex. "O07 A" (collection tube with column) --> "O07 L1" (snaptop centrifuge tube for liquid flow-through)
- Store snaptop centrifuge tubes in -80ºC freezer

#### **Wash salts through columns**:
- Added 200 µL of Solvent B to each column
- Spun columns for 3 minutes at 3000 rpm
 - Repeated 2 more times for a total of 3 spins
- Transfered remaining liquid to the second set of previously labelled snaptop centrifuge tubes
 - ex. "O07 A" (collection tube with column) --> "O07 L2" (snaptop centrifuge tube for liquid flow-through)
- Stored snaptop centrifuge tubes in -80ºC freezer

#### **Elute peptides**:
- Transfered column contents to the second set of previously labelled Macrospin columns
 - ex. "O07 A" (collection tube with column) --> "O07 B" (new collection tube with column)
- Added 100 µL of Solvent A to each column
- Spun columns for 3 minutes at 3000 rpm
 - Repeated 1 more time for a total of 2 spins
 - **Peptides are now in the liquid**
- Disposed of columns and keep collection tubes with liquid

#### **Evaporate peptides**:
- Using speed vacuum, evaporate samples to near dryness at 4ºC
 - Because someone else was using the speed vacuum when we arrived at the Genome Sciences building, we compromised and ran our samples with theirs at 8ºC.
- Speed vacuum start time: 4 p.m.

**Table 1**. Times samples were removed from speed vacuum. Samples were loaded at 4 p.m. at a temperature of 8ºC with refrigeration.

| **Sample** | **Time Removed from Speed Vacuum** |
|:----------:|:----------------------------------:|
|     O07    |              6:31 p.m.             |
|     O15    |              6:20 p.m.             |
|     O37    |              6:20 p.m.             |
|     O47    |              6:20 p.m.             |
|     O55    |              6:20 p.m.             |
|     O77    |              5:55 p.m.             |
|    O107    |              5:55 p.m.             |
|    O119    |              6:20 p.m.             |
|    O127    |              6:20 p.m.             |
|    O142    |              6:20 p.m.             |
|   OBLANK   |              5:55 p.m.             |

#### **Reconsitute peptides**:
- Added 60 µL of final solvent to each column
- Lighty vortexed all samples
- Centrifuged all samples down
- Stored samples in -80ºC freezer

We're done with extractions! We'll load these samples on the Mass Spectrometer in late January.
