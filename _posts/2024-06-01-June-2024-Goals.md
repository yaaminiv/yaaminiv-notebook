With all the chaos in my brain right now jumping between projects that are all urgent, I am Yoda. My overarching goal for the summer is to keep momentum on postdoc projects and wrap a few up into preprints (at least).

### [April (and I guess May?) Goals recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/April-2024-Goals/)

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- [Investigated specific metabolite and lipid pathways](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-Part28/)

**West Coast Green Crab Experiment**:

- Finished all extractions, PCRs, and gels!
- [Genotyped remaining 2023 crabs](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2023-Part56/)
- [Revised TTR analysis with all genotype data](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2023-Part56/)

**Cold Acclimation Green Crab Experiment**:

- [Planned this summer's experiments](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2024/)!
- [Tested experimental conditions](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2024-Part5/)
- [Designed new SMC primers](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2024-Part2/)
- [Tested new SMC primer protocol](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2024-Part4/)
- [Designed a restriction digest](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2024-Part6/)

**Killifish Methylation and Expression**:

- [Ran `BAT_analysis` and `BAT_DMRcalling` with new genome](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Killifish-Hypoxia-RRBS-Part24/)
- [Reran analysis allowing for one sample to have missing data per treatment group](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Killifish-Hypoxia-RRBS-Part25/)
- Updated methods and results

**Other**:

- Planned and started recruited participants for the RIE2 hackathon!
- Advertised RIE2 database
- Booked flights and hotels for SEB
- Started workshopping NSF ORCC proposal ideas

### June Goals

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- Finalize metabolomics analysis
- Finalize lipidomics analysis
- Update methods
- Update results

**West Coast Green Crab Experiment**:

- Genotype-specific mortality analysis
- Update summer notebook
- Identify samples for metabolomics and lipidomics sequencing
- Start manuscript

**Cold Acclimation Green Crab Experiment**:

- Develop heart rate protocol
- Obtain and label remaining MA crabs
- Genotype MA crabs
- Run MA experiment!
- Obtain and label WA crabs
- Start genotyping WA crabs

**Killifish Methylation and Expression**:

- Create general methylation figure
- DMR adjacency analysis
- Create DMR figure
- Identify SNPs in DMR
- Update methods
- Update results

**Other**:

- Make poster for SEB
- Continue developing ideas for NSF ORCC proposal
- Work on CEABiGR reviewer comments
- Finalize participant list for the RIE2 hackathon
- Plan RIE2 hackathon launch event

### Deep Freeze

Things that are not immediate enough to be on the backburner, so they're stuck in the deep freeze.

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

These are things I need to do and can probably knock out in a week, but I think they're a lower priority right now for me since there's more momentum on other projects.

- Revise abstract
- Write discussion
- Write introduction

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

I'll return to this when I have a good draft of the coral paper.

- Finish `methylKit` contingency tests
- Conduct a randomization test for DML identification
- Integrate other epigenetic datasets
- Update methods and results
- Revise discussion

**Zebrafish DNMT**:

I'll think about this once I have a robust killifish paper draft.

- Identify a stress condition to use for the zebrafish based on disease factors or conditions that are known to induce changes in methylation
- Determine physiological endpoints to assess for embryos
- Construct a project timeline
