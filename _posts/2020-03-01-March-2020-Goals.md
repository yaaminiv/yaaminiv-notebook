Me trying to make connections between my quals readings and themes...T-15 days rIP.

### **[February Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/February-2020-Goals/)**:

**Quals**:

- Made good progress on my first read but then paused to work on analyses for Ocean Sciences and work on my manuscript revision...which is kind of indirectly studying right?

**Gigas Gonad Methylation**:

- Comparex *C. gigas* and *C. virginica* [sequencing methods and general methylation landscapes](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Gigas-and-Virginica-Comparison/)
- [Generated and compared methylation islands for both species](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Gigas-and-Virginica-Comparison-Part2/)
- [Compared *C. gigas* and *C. virginica* DML lists](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Gigas-and-Virginica-Comparison-Part3/)
- Did not conduct GO-MWU and DMG analysis for *C. gigas* DML. With two samples total, I realized I wouldn't have any sort of statistical power for meaningful conclusions
- [Put together poster for Ocean Sciences](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Gigas-and-Virginica-Comparison-Part4/)!

**Virginica Gonad Methylation**:

- [Addressed reviewer comments](https://yaaminiv.github.io/DML-Analysis-Part45/) and [epigenetics reading group feedback](https://yaaminiv.github.io/DML-Analysis-Part46/)!

**All Mechanism Study**:

- Tried [extracting RNA and DNA from adductor tissue](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Gigas-Broodstock-RNA-Extraction/)...did not go well so I gave up on labwork for the month.

**Other**:

- Reviewed paper for ICES!

### March Goals

**Quals**:

- Finish first and second read of all materials to establish connections to topic, other topics, and my research
- Meet with committee members to recap expectations for the exam
- Take the exam...maybe even pass

**Other**:

- Eat, sleep, don't get coronavirus and all that jazz

**Quals**
