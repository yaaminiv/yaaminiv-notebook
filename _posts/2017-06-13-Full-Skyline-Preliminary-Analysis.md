title: Full Skyline Preliminary Analysis
---

## I was gifted 3,000 extra proteins

When [error checking](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Skyline-Error-Checking-Round2/) the new Skyline document from the revised "desearlinated" .blib, I noticed that I had 9,047 proteins instead of about 6,000. Where did these 3,000 extra proteins come from? What do they do? To answer this question, I ran the new Skyline output through the [same preliminary pipeline](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Preliminary-Data-Analysis/) I used for my [NSA poster](https://yaaminiv.github.io/NSA-Poster/).

Videos of my narrating my findings quietly because I'm at my parents' house and they're asleep:

Most interesting finding: miRNA inhibition of translation is a significant GO term for biological processes that's overrepresented across all of my samples!
