I tried to do write I promise!! Those writing tasks just expanded into other tasks as I iterated and re-iterated my methods and results...so maybe now I can write?

### [November Goals recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/November-2023-Goals/)

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- [Planned metabolomics analyses](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-Part20/)

**West Coast Green Crab Experiment**:

- [Tried extracting prioritized TTR samples](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2023-Part28/)
- [Ended up at decontamination station (and I still haven't left)](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2023-Part29/)

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

- FINALLY ran a KOG analysis!
- Started digging into gene lists, with several iterations of making tables that I think will be informative as I parse through the loads of data I now have
- Started outlining discussion

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

- Poor Hawaii paper, so neglected that I never get around to actually doing anything for it

**Other**:

- Submitted faculty applications
- Re-reviewed paper for Aquaculture
- Reviewed grant proposal for Genome BC
- Did not launch RIE2 survey as I was waiting for confirmation about SMBE IDEA grant
- Performed literature search for WOCinEEB Global Change collaboration
- Kept up with meetings for CEABiGR

### December Goals

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- Conduct metabolomics analysis
- Conduct lipidomics analysis
- Draft talk for SICB

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

- Finish interpreting gene lists
- Outline discussion
- Write discussion
- Outline introduction
- Write introduction
- Write abstract

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

- Finish `methylKit` contingency tests
- Conduct a randomization test for DML identification
- Integrate other epigenetic datasets
- Update methods and results
- Revise discussion

**West Coast Green Crab Experiment**:

- Revisit Julia's samples for genotyping
- Return to decontamination station and try to escape
- Revise summer lab notebook

**Other**:

- Submit additional faculty applications
- Review paper for PLOS Climate
- Review paper for Biological Bulletin
- Launch RIE2 survey
- Work on PRISMA searches for WOCinEEB Global Change collaboration

### Deep Freeze

Things that are not immediate enough to be on the backburner, so they're stuck in the deep freeze.

**Virginica Methylation and Expression**:

I'll return to this when I have an updated discussion for the Hawaii paper.

- Update methods and results from quadratic addition to transcriptional noise model
- Compare transcriptional noise analysis with Liew and Aranda papers

**Killifish Methylation and Expression**:

I'll return to this when I have a good draft of the coral paper.

- Pathway analysis for RNA-Seq data
- Determine protocol for SNP identification
- Conduct in silico RRBS digestion
- Characterize DEG that overlap between populations
- Quantify gene expression variability
- Visualize DEG data

**Zebrafish DNMT**:

I'll think about this once I have a robust killifish paper draft.

- Identify a stress condition to use for the zebrafish based on disease factors or conditions that are known to induce changes in methylation
- Determine physiological endpoints to assess for embryos
- Construct a project timeline
