---

## Experiment log: WA acclimation

It's the week before the experiment so it's officially acclimation week!

### 2024-07-15

- No mortalities!
- Ammonia check and water change for all tanks
- Moved tanks on lower rack that are really close to the light to the other side where there is no light. I'll either need to add a strip light there OR move the other tanks to the floor under the rack lights so they are on the same circadian rhythm.
- Labelled crabs in T1-T3

### 2024-07-16

- No mortalities!
  - Although, Heidi found a piece of carapace but no crabs seemed to have died...?!
- Labelled crabs in T4-T8

### 2024-07-17

- 241 dead (it felt squishy like it had just molted, and Heidi did find that carapace piece yesterday)

### 2024-07-18

- Ammonia checks and water changes for all tanks
- No mortalities!

### 2024-07-19

- Skipped today

### Going forward

1. Label WA crabs
2. Genotype WA crabs
3. Conduct WA experiment
4. Develop heart rate protocol
