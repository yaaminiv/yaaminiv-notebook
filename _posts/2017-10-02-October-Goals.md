**September Goals Recap**:

- I presented a preliminary analysis of my SRM data at [PCSGA](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-oyster-oa/blob/master/presentations/DNR/PCSGA2017_Venkataraman.pptx)!
- The DNR paper got split into two separate papers. I added SRM methods to the [oyster paper](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1giP16iXWPE7oDSNI7fyLV3p_1jqsXuuxlH7cJQAwhLM/edit#heading=h.7vvlns7jaib) but have not updated any SRM results. The associated repository can be found [here](https://github.com/RobertsLab/paper-gigas-DNR-proteomics).
- Steven suggested not revising the proposal, so I didn't
- I sent an email to schedule my first committee for the end of October/beginning of November. To prepare for my meeting, I cleaned up the [project-oyster-oa repo](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-oyster-oa). The repository has very clear README files and project/file descriptions!

**October Goals**:

This month is all about the DNR project!

- Figure out what happened with my [technical replicates](https://yaaminiv.github.io/SRM-Analysis-Part5/)
- Revise the oyster paper introduction and methods, start writing results and discussion
- Submit a NSF GRFP proposal
- Have my committee meeting and submit milestone paperwork
- Prepare for WSN
- Low priority: Metaanalysis and Manchester
  - I can start reviewing papers and writing an introduction. If there are any interesting questions I think we should tackle with the dataset, then I can consult with Steven and start analyses
  - Analyze histology images
