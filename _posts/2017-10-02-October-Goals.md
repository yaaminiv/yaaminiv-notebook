**September Goals Recap**:

- I presented a preliminary analysis of my SRM data at [PCSGA]()!
- The DNR paper got split into two separate papers. I added SRM methods to the [oyster paper]() but have not updated any SRM results
- Steven suggested not revising the proposal, so I didn't
- I sent an email to schedule my first committee for the end of October/beginning of November. To prepare for my meeting, I cleaned up the [project-oyster-oa repo](). The repository has very clear README files and project/file descriptions!

**October Goals**:

- Figure out what happened with my [technical replicates]()
- Revise the oyster paper introduction and methods, start writing results and discussion
- Submit a NSF GRFP proposal
- Have my committee meeting and submit milestone paperwork
- Prepare for WSN
- Low priority: Metaanalysis and Manchester
  - I can start reviewing papers and writing an introduction. If there are any interesting questions I think we should tackle with the dataset, then I can consult with Steven and start analyses
  - Analyze histology images
