title: August Goals

## I only have three goals

...and I think I can accomplish them! But first, a [July Goals](https://yaaminiv.github.io/July-Goals/) recap.

- Finished [target analysis](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Selecting-SRM-Targets-Part7/)
- [Ran samples on the mass spectrometer](https://yaaminiv.github.io/SRM-Assay-Day9/)
- Conditioned and [spawned oysters](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Gigas-Larvae-Day0/)
- Joth agreed to be on my committee!

### August Goals:

- Keep larvae alive
- Analyze SRM data
- Schedule first committee meeting
- Finalize proposal and plan of study
- Talk to Steven about funding after Summer 2018

And who knows? Maybe I'll have time to do the metaanalysis when the larvae are grown and I don't have anymore mass spectrometer data to play with. A girl can only hope.
