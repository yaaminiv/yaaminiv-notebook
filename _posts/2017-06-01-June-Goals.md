title: June 2017 Goals
---

## (Almost) done with Spring Quarter already?!

Can't believe it's already June! In keeping with the [April](https://yaaminiv.github.io/April-Goals/) and [May](https://yaaminiv.github.io/May-Goals/) #MemeThemes, here's a picture of Mama June from Here Comes Honey Boo Boo that properly expresses my reaction to the passage of time.

**[May Goals](https://yaaminiv.github.io/May-Goals/) Recap**
- Developed a [preliminary heat shock plan](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Heat-Shock-Practice/), but it needs to be revised
- In-depth spawning plan preparation put on halt because I can't get in contact with Molly
- [Skyline is tempermental](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Another-Skyline-Fail/) so I don't have a list of targets yet
- I wrote an [introduction for the DNR paper](https://docs.google.com/a/uw.edu/document/d/1giP16iXWPE7oDSNI7fyLV3p_1jqsXuuxlH7cJQAwhLM/edit?usp=drive_web)! It's rough, but it's made of real words :smile:
- Not only do I have an extraction plan, but the extractions are well underway
- I have the pipeline for my metaanalysis ready to go, but I need either emu or roadrunner to be free so I can start. The days those machines are free are when I'm not, so by the time I'm free, the machines are occupied again. Whoops :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

**June Goals**

- Heat shock oysters
- Have an in-depth spawning plan
- Get Skyline to function
- Create a list of targets
- Finish extractions
- Finally, FINALLY start that metaanalysis pipeline so it's no longer a pipe dream

It's quite a chunk of work, especially considering I'll be working from California for a week. But I think it's doable considering the fact that I won't have any classes!
