## March Maddness is upon us.

It's the month of NSA! For this reason, my priorities will shift towards conference preparation. I'm also going to add in dates for myself so I space out my progress (does this mean I'm getting better at realistic goal-setting??).

#### NSA Preparation 
- PECAN Analysis
 - All of my computer issues are resolved, so I can prepare all of the inputs and run PECAN. I may have to modify my run, since it's taking Laura 12 full days to finish running all of her samples and blanks.
- Skyline Analysis
  - I hope I can start on some of this before I leave town on March 14.
- Poster
 - Draft 1: Title, Introduction, Methods (Complete by March 10)
 - Draft 2: Preliminary Results (Complete by March 14)
 - Draft 3: Finalized Results, Discussion (Complete by March 23)
- DNR Paper
 - Finalize Methods: March 8
 - Introduction: March 10
 - Preliminary Results: March 14
 - Finalized Results and Discussion: March 23

#### C. gigas Metaanalysis Paper
