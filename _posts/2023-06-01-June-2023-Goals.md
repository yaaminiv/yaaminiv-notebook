This, but experimental logistics and data analysis when you've also taken 2.5 weeks off. It was really brave of me to think that I'd get any heavy work done last month!

### [May Goals recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/May-2023-Goals/)

**Green Crab Summer Experiment**:

- [Came up with project ideas for Julia and Lauren!](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2023-Part2/)
- [Ordered almost all needed experimental materials]()

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- [Completed the demographic data analysis](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-Part17/)
- Updated methods and results
- Didn't get a chance to start the respirometry analysis since I shifted focus to the 2023 experiment logistics

**Other**:

- Started the Mindful Productivity course!

### June Goals

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- ANALYZE. THE. RESPIROMETRY. DATA. Preferrably before I start this summer's experiment
- Send metabolomics samples to UC Davis for sequencing

**West Coast Green Crab Experiment**:

- Finish buying all experimental materials
- Set up ESL
- Receive the Washington crabs!!
- Label and measure all crabs for the experiment
- Start the temperature treatments!!

**Summer Students**:

- Julia
  - Finalize summer project
  - Write letter for senior thesis proposal
  - Review SSF Research and Communication Plan
  - Review senior thesis proposal
- Lauren
  - Finalize summer project
  - Complete mentor-mentee agreement
  - Order any necessary materials
  - Identify test samples for summer assays

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

- Add Rajan's edits as comments to the draft manuscript
- Review `EpiDiverse` output and create a new SNP list
- Rerun `methylKit`
- Conduct a randomization test for DML identification
- Update methods and results

**Virginica Methylation and Expression**:

- Update methods and results from quadratic addition to transcriptional noise model
- Compare transcriptional noise analysis with Liew and Aranda papers

### Deep Freeze

Things that are not immediate enough to be on the backburner, so they're stuck in the deep freeze.

**Killifish Methylation and Expression**:

I'll return to this when I have a good draft of the coral paper.

- Pathway analysis for RNA-Seq data
- Determine protocol for SNP identification
- Conduct in silico RRBS digestion
- Characterize DEG that overlap between populations
- Quantify gene expression variability
- Visualize DEG data

**Zebrafish DNMT**:

I'll think about this once I have a robust killifish paper draft.

- Identify a stress condition to use for the zebrafish based on disease factors or conditions that are known to induce changes in methylation
- Determine physiological endpoints to assess for embryos
- Construct a project timeline
