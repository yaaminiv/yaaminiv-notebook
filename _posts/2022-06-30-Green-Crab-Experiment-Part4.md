## Acclimation Day 2

- Systems check: air line power strip on, aquarium filter power strip off
  - Not good! I turned the aquarium filters on at 1 p.m., so they had been sitting in unfiltered water for less than 24 hours.
  - Carolyn suggested I check the ammonia concentration in the tanks as a precaution using an ammonium test kit. I obtained 5 mL of water from tanks 1, 3, and 6 to check. The concentration in each tank was between 1.0-2.0, so I did a full water change for all the tanks

  **Figures 1-3**. Ammonia concentration in tanks 1, 3, and 6

  - Aquarium filter not working in T4: Disassembled the filter and reassembled it. Must have been clogged since it works now
- Mortality check: I went through with a dip net to disturb the crabs and check that they were alive
  - T1: 0 dead
  - T2: 0 dead
  - T3: 1 dead
  - T4: 0 dead
  - T5: 0 dead
  - T6: 0 dead
- Added 5 mL (the appropriate amount for 10 gallon tanks) of aquarium ammonium conditioner to each tank Carolyn gave me to help control the waste products!
- Fed all crabs: I shook some crab food on top of the tank where the crabs were located and hoped it was enough

### Going forward

1. Standardize food going into each tank
2. Add clamps to chambers so I don't have to hold the probe to the chamber
3. Obtain flexible mesh for acclimation
6. Cover respiration chambers with paper or black plastic to simulate night conditions
9. Get refractometer for salinity measurements
