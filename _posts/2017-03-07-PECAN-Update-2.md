## To reconvert or not reconvert?

Spoiler alert: The answer is to reconvert.

In my [previous post](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Pecan-Run-1-Update-1/), I set out a game plan to troubleshoot my `pecanpie` run. First, Laura and I played around with the [.blib file](http://owl.fish.washington.edu/spartina/DNR_PECAN_Run_1_20170303_Output/pecan2blib/DNR_PECAN_Run_1_20170303_SpLibrary.blib) produced as part of my [PECAN Run 1 Output](http://owl.fish.washington.edu/spartina/DNR_PECAN_Run_1_20170303_Output/).

We followed the instructions in [this powerpoint](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-pacific.oyster-larvae/blob/master/Skyline-example-files-ETS.sky/slides01.pdf) after downloading [Skyline daily](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0ahUKEwjj8cfl98XSAhVJi1QKHTeTAx4QFggcMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fskyline.ms%2Fproject%2Fhome%2Fsoftware%2FSkyline%2Fdaily%2Fregister-form%2Fbegin.view%3F&usg=AFQjCNGCxWGw2YgD5wKFZ24OBuV37He6ZA&sig2=DDOmDgqRwiN8yK56wC4poA) on the Windows machine. We successfully uploaded the background proteome to Skyline, but when we uploaded the .blib file, we got an error message:

This supports Sean's finding that nothing was ever generated by PECAN because it couldn't find what it considered to be valid MS2 data in my mzML files and stopped there. This did not happen to Laura's files, which is weird because we underwent the same MSConvert process. I will reconvert one raw file to an mzML file and rerun PECAN. Hopefully that will yield a usable .blib file!
