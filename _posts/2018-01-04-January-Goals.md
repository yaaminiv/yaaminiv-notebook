## I guess break is over...

...and what a great break it was! I did nothing for 1.5 weeks. I kind of regret it (you'll find out soon), but I also really don't. #yolo

**[December Goals](https://yaaminiv.github.io/December-Goals/) Recap**:

- Didn't finish proteomics paper...because break
- Succesfully [identified a sequencing protocol](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Sequencing-Protocol-Thoughts/)!
- Didn't prepare samples...because Sam and I were confused about who was doing what.
- Didn't add Disqus to my blog...because break (also I forgot I wanted to do this)

**January Goals**:

- Finish the proteomics paper by January 11! That gives me about a week to finish writing, address Steven and Emma's comments, and look it over before I send it off for more formal edits
- Run *C. virginica* samples through MBD-Seq protocol
- Figure out what to do with *C. virginica* samples after I get them back from sequencing
- Finish *C. gigas* histology analyses
- Come up with plan for *C. gigas* MBD-Seq analyses, since that's part of what I'm discussing at NSA
- Think about the metaanalysis again! Maybe do some concrete work on that since Pubathon will be coming up soon
