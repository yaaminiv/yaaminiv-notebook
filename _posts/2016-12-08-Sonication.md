## Gill Tissue + Sound Waves = Protein Soup

Sonication uses sound waves to agitate the particles of a solution. For our purposes, sonication allows us to lyse cell walls and extract the protein inside. Here's how we did it!

Once again, our protocol was adapted from [Rhonda's work](https://github.com/sr320/LabDocs/blob/master/protocols/ProteinprepforMSMS.md).

#### **Added Made 50 mM NH4HCO3 + 6M urea solution to samples**

- Removed samples from -80ºC freezer and placed in rack
- Pipetted 500 µL 50 mM NH4HCO3 + 6M urea solution into one sample tube
- Repeated for all samples + 1 blank

#### **Homogenized samples**
- An up-and-down motion worked better than a side-to-side motion (pounding > smushing)
- Homogenized as much as possible
  - Resulting mixture was cloudy, difficult to see tissue fragments
- Repeated for all samples + 1 blank
  
#### **Vortexed samples**
- 3 pulses on vortex set to speed 10 (maximum speed)
- Repeated for all samples + 1 blank

After these steps, we took dry ice, wet ice and our samples over to the Genome Sciences building to use their sonicator.
