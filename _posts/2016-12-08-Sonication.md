## Gill Tissue + Sound Waves = Protein Soup

Sonication uses sound waves to agitate the particles of a solution. For our purposes, sonication allows us to lyse cell walls and extract the protein inside. Here's how we did it!

Once again, our protocol was adapted from [Rhonda's work](https://github.com/sr320/LabDocs/blob/master/protocols/ProteinprepforMSMS.md).

#### **Added Made 50 mM NH4HCO3 + 6M urea solution to samples**

- Removed samples from -80ºC freezer and placed in rack
- Pipetted 500 µL 50 mM NH4HCO3 + 6M urea solution into one sample tube

#### **Homogenized samples**
- An up-and-down motion worked better than a side-to-side motion (pounding > smushing)
- Homogenized as much as possible
  - Resulting mixture was cloudy, difficult to see tissue fragments
  
#### **Vortexed samples**
- 3 pulses on vortex set to speed 10 (maximum speed)

After these steps, we took dry ice, wet ice and our samples over to the Genome Sciences building to use their sonicator.
