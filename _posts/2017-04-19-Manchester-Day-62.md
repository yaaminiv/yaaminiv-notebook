## Laura went out to Manchester today and graciously cleaned my oysters

She found one dead in bag Tank 3B. She shucked it open to check for anything unusual, but found nothing.

**Figures 1-2**. Dead oyster found in bag Tank 3B.

**Table 1**. Updated number of oysters in each bag per tank.

|  Tank |  A |  B | Total |
|:-----:|:--:|:--:|:-----:|
|   1   |  8 |  9 |   17  |
|   2   |  9 |  8 |   14  |
|   3   |  7 |  6 |   13  |
|   4   |  9 |  8 |   17  |
|   5   |  9 |  9 |   18  |
|   6   |  8 |  8 |   16  |
| **Total** | **50** | **49** |   **98**  |

There was also a lot of stringy stuff in the tanks, probably due the higher oyster density.

**Figures 3-4**. Stringy stuff found in my tanks.

Laura increased the flow on all tanks. She thinks the stuff may be related to the algae paste we feed the oysters. More information to follow.
