I got a good amount of work done last month, but not as much as I needed to! However, I'm still feeling motivated so I'm going to ride that motivation before and after my end-of-summer vacation.

### [August Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/August-2024-Goals/)

### August Goals

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- [Finalized metabolomics analysis!](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-Part30/)
- [Created metabolomics figures!](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-Part31/)
- Updated methods and results

**West Coast Green Crab Experiment**:

...still didn't do anything with this

**Cold Acclimation Green Crab Experiment**:

- [Analyzed WA TTR data!](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2024-Part22/)

**Killifish Methylation and Expression**:

- [Examined DMR-DEG overlaps!](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Killifish-Hypoxia-RRBS-Part28/)
- [Ran `BAT_correlating`!](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Killifish-Hypoxia-RRBS-Part29/)
- [Created DMR figures!](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Killifish-Hypoxia-RRBS-Part30/)
- Updated methods and results

**Other**:

- Supervised Catlin and Heidi as they analyze data and make their final presentations!
- Submitted SICB abstract for short-term acclimation paper
- Updated CV
- Submitted CEABiGR paper revision!
- Drafted NSF ORCC project summary

### September Goals

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- Repeated measures analysis without crab ID for TTR data
- Finalize lipidomics analysis
- Determine if physiology data can be integrated with -omics data
- Determine if metabolomics and lipidomics data can be integrated
- Update methods
- Update results
- Write discussion
- Write introduction
- Write abstract

**West Coast Green Crab Experiment**:

- Update summer notebook
- Identify samples for metabolomics and lipidomics sequencing

**Cold Acclimation Green Crab Experiment**:

- Return to troubleshooting DNA extractions
- Return to troubleshooting triglyceride assay

**NSF ORCC**:

- Reread relevant literature
- Finalize project summary
- Full grant draft
- Send materials to collaborators

**Job Applications**:

- Create job application schedule
- Update job application materials
- Apply for relevant jobs

**Killifish Methylation and Expression**:

- Update methods and results
- Assist with discussion writing

### Deep Freeze

Things that are not immediate enough to be on the backburner, so they're stuck in the deep freeze.

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

These are things I need to do and can probably knock out in a week, but I think they're a lower priority right now for me since there's more momentum on other projects.

- Revise abstract
- Write discussion
- Write introduction

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

I'll return to this when the CEABiGR paper is published.

- Finish `methylKit` contingency tests
- Conduct a randomization test for DML identification
- Integrate other epigenetic datasets
- Update methods and results
- Revise discussion
