## Checking on temperatures

I left the room untouched for five days! Let's see what happened.

**Figures 3-6**: Temperatures in 5ºC tanks

**Figures 7-10**: Temperatures in 0ºC tanks


The back of the room is around ~0.5ºC and the front is around ~1ºC even though the room is set to 0.2ºC. I think it's good to keep the colder tanks in the back. I'll need to figure out if I can move a set of rack lights to the front of the room where I plan on having the 5ºC tanks. After the weekend, I'll also bump the temperature on the outside of the room to 0ºC to see if that can lower the temperature of back tanks. It's promising that they're staying pretty constant around ~0.7ºC though! The 5ºC tanks look good...when they're actually on. I unknowingly plugged them into a timer outlet, so I moved them to normal outlets and will check after the long weekend. It's also interesting that my second tank from the door is slightly cooler than my tank closest to the door. I wonder how much of this is because it's directly under the cooling fans, or if the ~0.3ºC can be attributed to calibration differences. Temperatures may also change if I add additional tanks, so I'm not going to worry about this too much more for now.

Overall I think I have a few more tweaks and I should be good to go!

### Going forward

1. Check temperature of tanks
3. Identify candidate restriction enzymes for new primers
3. Develop restriction band digest for genotyping
4. Order materials for summer experiments
4. Develop heart rate protocol
