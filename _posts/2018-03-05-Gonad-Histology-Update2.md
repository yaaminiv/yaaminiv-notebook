## I think I understand classification better now

I met with Molly in February to discuss histology classificiation methods. She suggested I read Mladineo et al. 2007 and Ropes 1968 for their descriptions of maturation stages, as well as better pictures to help me discern between sexes and stages. I read the papers and they were very helpful! Mladineo et al. 2007 also had some interesting visuals and analysis methods that I could use if I find any significant differences in maturation between treatments. 

I downloaded the original [Google Sheets document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1ObTeYRQwELWhLLdVcAzt4SWPJgtj0u2QmoAxfjgFqtw/edit?pli=1#gid=0) and saved it as a [.csv file in my repository](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-oyster-oa/blob/master/data/Manchester/2018-02-27-Gigas-Histology-Classification.csv). I then revised my classifications. I felt more confident assigning sexes than I did before, which made some of the stage classification a bit easier. I still have my doubts on a few classifications, so I'm going to send it over to Brent to see if he can help me now that Molly's busy with work at Taylor.

Remeber those red spots I said I saw in my [previous histology update](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Gonad-Histology-Update/)? I emailed those pictures to Lisa Crosson. She sent me this response:

> I think they might be ferrous cells/granules which typically have a brown/red "blob" morphology. I've seen them before in shellfish digestive, kidney and gonadal tissues likely due to the fact that there is a lot of cellular turnover going on leaving behind iron deposits. Could also be a random staining artifact which happens from time to time.

In my classification spreadsheet, I added a column for ferrous inclusions. I don't know if this could be realted to maturation stage or sex, but it could be interesting to see if there's a difference in presence/absence between treatments.

Now that I feel more confident with my classifications, I can work on analyzing them. If I make any change to the classifications, all I need to do is read my .csv file in again!
