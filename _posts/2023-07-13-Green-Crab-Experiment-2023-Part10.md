## Treatment Days 14-15

**7/12/23**:

- Cleaned tanks
- No mortalities...until ~ 2 p.m. 25-108 in T6 was eaten after TTR data for that crab was taken.
  - T1: 11
  - T2: 11
  - T3: 11
  - T4: 12
  - T5: 11
  - T6: 9
  - T7: 11
  - T8: 11
  - T9: 10
  - T10: 12
  - T11: 10
  - T12: 13
- Cold TTR and respirometry
  - Tank order: T1, T4, T7
  - T4: Fitting part superglued onto the chamber with probe 2 came off at the beginning. Needed to use the back-up chamber for probe 2. Readings looked really noisy (jagged peaks) until I adjusted probes midway. Should always look like "smooth" readings instead of jagged peaks.
- Warm TTR and respirometry
  - Tank order: T9, T3, T6
  - T9: Needed to duct tape the fititng part superglued onto the chamber for probe 3 since it's coming loose.
  - T6: Forgot to ethanol chambers between T3 and T6. Very fast respiration for T6, but could also be because 25-108 was consumed before respirometry. Unsure how much the respirometry crabs actually ate of 25-108.
- Touched up superglued fitting part for chambers
- Updated TTR spreadsheet
- Updates survivorship spreadsheet
- Updated metadata with dead day for 25-108

**7/13/23**:

- Cleaned, replaced 60% of water, and ammonia tested all tanks. Tanks with ammonia > 1.0 had conditioner added
  - T1: 0.25
  - T4: 0.50
  - T7: 0.25
  - T2: 2.0
  - T8: 4.0
  - T5: 8.0
  - T9: 8.0
  - T3: 2.0
  - T6: 8.0
- One mortality in T12 (10-148).
  - T1: 11
  - T2: 11
  - T3: 11
  - T4: 12
  - T5: 11
  - T6: 9
  - T7: 11
  - T8: 11
  - T9: 10
  - T10: 12
  - T11: 10
  - T12: 12
- Performed 15ºC respirometry.
- Fed 5ºC, 10ºC, and 25ºC crabs after cleaning. Fed 15ºC crabs after respirometry.
- Updated TTR spreadsheet
- Updated ammonia spreadsheet
- Updated survivorship spreadsheet
- Updated dead day on metadata spreadsheet

### Going forward

1. Continue doing daily checks and with experimental time points
2. Assist Lauren and Julia with experiments
2. Test formatting and analysis for one set of respirometry data
7. Respirometry analysis
8. Update methods
9. Update results
