### [October Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/October-2019-Goals/)

**Virginica Gonad Methylation**:

- I got comments from all my co-authors. Aside from some new plots, I started revising my introduction and then...I burned out. RIP.

**Gigas Gonad Methylation**:

- [Annotated genes with DMML with GOslim terms](https://yaaminiv.github.io/WGBS-Analysis-Part8/) and made some new plots
- [Presented at WSN!](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-oa-meth/blob/master/presentations/Venkataraman_FRI_1515.pptx) Overall it was a really good and energizing experience (maybe I have enough energy to work on *C. virginica* stuff who knows).

**Other**:

- Had a committee meeting. Decided to merge the *C. gigas* and *C. virginica* intergenerational work into one larger chapter. I filled out all of my post-committee meeting paperwork and now I'm just waiting on an electronic signature to submit it!
- Gave a active learning-style lecture in Marine Biology on ocean acidification! We'll see how much people learned based on the midterm.

### November Goals

**Virginica Gonad Methylation**:

- Find motivation.
- Create new figures based on edits
- Address all edits and send out for another review
- Clean up repository and add relevant supplementary material
- Prepare metadata for BCO-DMO submission
- SUBMIT THAT PAPER!
- Rejoice.

**Gigas Gonad Methylation**:

- Present at the 2019 Graduate Student Symposium
- Figure out if more samples should be sequenced...maybe using a Swift kit due to low DNA yield?
- Attempt GO-MWU enrichment and DMG analysis

**Other**:

- Write ocean acidification questions for the midterm
- Finalize sample preparation flowchart for methylation analysis
- Figure out next steps for *C. virginica* sperm analysis
- Submit committee meeting paperwork
