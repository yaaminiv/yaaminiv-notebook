### [January Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/January-2022-Goals/)

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

- I'm working on the coral samples, but we have yet to nail down a protocol that provides sufficient yield and quality!
- Switched from one species to another since the second species may be easier to work with

**Killifish Methylation and Expression**:

- I didn't get the data yet, so I didn't work on this and focused on the coral extraction protocol instead!

**Gigas Gonad Methylation**:

- I made progress on the discussion! But not enough to finish it.

**Virginica Gonad Methylation**:

- Participated in weekly discussions with Sam and Steven about analyses. Steven and I decided to use this project for CEABIGR, which means there's nothing I have to do for this project by myself.

**Ocean Acidification and Reproduction Review**:

- Integrated new papers into main text and supplementary material
- Included new studies in revised Figure 2

### February Goals

**Gigas Gonad Methylation**:

- FINALLY finish the discussion
- Revise the introduction and abstract
- Send to Steven for edits
- Submit to a journal and bioRXiv

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

- Continue testing extraction protocol to identify a successful methods
- Use gel to check RNA integrity
- Extract all samples possible

**Killifish Methylation and Expression**:

- Review BAT mapping and DMR identification protocol
- Start mapping procedure for methylation data
- Identify protocol for RNA-Seq data

**Ocean Acidification and Reproduction Review**:

- Start integrating new papers into main text and supplemental material
- Revise figures

**Other**:

- Meet with Carolyn, Ann, and Neel to discuss projects and funding opportunities for the next six months
- Develop any potential projects
- Coordinate postdoctoral mentoring program with Maggi

### Deep Freeze

After a conversation with CAN, I realized that I'm taking too much on! They suggested I table some projects for a while, so here are things that are not immediate enough to be on the backburner, so they're stuck in the deep freeze.

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

- Address Rajan's edits
- Review `DSS` script and determine if I should go back to `methylKit` for better interpretation
- Extract SNPs with `EpiDiverse` and create a relatedness matrix
- Look at methylation islands and non-methylated regions
- Examine overlaps between DML and other epigenomic datasets from Sascha
