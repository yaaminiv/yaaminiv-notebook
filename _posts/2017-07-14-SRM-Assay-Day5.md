## Still plugging along

My samples are still looking good on the mass spec! I should be done by Sunday evening. Since Laura's out of town for the weekend, Grace and I brought her samples down to UWPR to prepare them. However, our PRTC didn't arrive yet, and neither did the vial caps for Laura's samples. Therefore, we couldn't prepare her samples. This is something I'm going to have to do this weekend. I got another QC and PRTC vial from Emma and kept it in the Roberts Lab -80ÂºC freezer. I'll need to bring these down to UWPR when I prepare Laura's samples.
