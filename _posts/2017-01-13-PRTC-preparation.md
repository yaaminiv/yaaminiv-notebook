## PRTC: We know what those peptides can be

This is the last step in the lab before we go on the mass spectrometer! PRTC, or Peptide Retention Time Calibration, is a mix of known peptides and known quantities that we can use to ensure the mass spectrometer is functioning. It also provides a reference for our sample analysis.

#### **Procedure**:

- Removed samples from -80ºC. Place in wet ice bath and allow to thaw
- Labelled new centrifuge tubes and glass autosampler vials, one for each sample
- Diluted stock PRTC
 - Pipetted [INSERT QUANTITY HERE] of PRTC into a clean centrifuge tube
 - Added [INSERT QUANTITY HERE] of Final Solvent (3% acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid) to PRTC
 - Vortexed gently to thoroughly mix contents
- To each newly labelled sample centrifuge tube, added the following reagents
 - [INSERT QUANTITY HERE] of Final Solvent
 - [INSERT QUANTITY HERE] of sample removed from -80ºC
 - [INSERT QUANTITY HERE] of PRTC
  - Because we pipetted such small quantities of PRTC, we ensured the pipet tip was touching the bottom of the centrifuge tube so all liquid was transferred
 - Vortexed gently to thoroughly mix contents
 - Centrifuged liquid down to the bottom of the centrfuge tube

After we prepared the samples with PRTC, we gave everything to Emma, who put the samples in her lab's -80ºC. When we are ready to use the mass spectrometer, we will transfer the contents of the centrifuge tubes to the labelled glass autosampler vials.
