Jumanji understands how studying for quals works (or doesn't work...depends on the day). What else am I planning on doing this month?!

### **[January Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/January-2020-Goals/)**:

**Virginica Gonad Methylation**:

**Gigas Gonad Methylation**:

- I didn't get a chance to do a GO-MWU enrichment or DMG analysis, but I reviewed my [last post](https://yaaminiv.github.io/WGBS-Analysis-Part8/) on *C. gigas* analysis.
- [Made a labwork preparation plan](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Gigas-Labwork-Plans/)! The sequencing plan is to figure out the plan later.
- I held off on putting together an ASLO poster, but I figured out what metrics to include on the poster itself.

**Virginica Sperm Methylation**:

- Didn't tackle anything related to *C. virginica* sperm samples. We're putting this on the backburner for now.

** All Mechanism Study**:

- [Came up with an extraction plan](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Gigas-Labwork-Plans/)! I also [started looking into ATAC-Seq](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Figuring-out-ATAC-Seq/), but I'll return to this next quarter when I have more time to dedicate to protocl testing. 

**Other**:

- [Submitted the *C. virginica* paper to bioRXiv and cleaned up the repository](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Final-Virginica-Tasks/)!
- Got all my committee reading lists and start studying for quals. Turns out reading takes a lot of energy and requires many snack and nap breaks.

### **[February Goals]**:

**Quals**:

- Finish an initial read of all materials, including comprehensive notes
- Finish second read of all materials to establish connections to topic, other topics, and my research
- Meet with committee members as necessary to guide first and second reads

**Gigas Gonad Methylation**:

- Compare *C. gigas* and *C. virginica* sequencing methods
- Compare *C. gigas* and *C. virginica* general methylation landscape
- Compare *C. gigas* and *C. virginica* DML lists
- Conduct GO-MWU and DMG analysis for *C. gigas* DML and compare to *C. virginica* results
- Put together poster for ASLO

**Virginica Gonad Methylation**:

- Address reviewer comments and send to collaborators for review

**All Mechanism Study**:

- Extract RNA from frozen tissue samples
- Extract DNA from frozen tissue samples
- Extract RNA from histology blocks

**Other**:

- Review paper for ICES
- Try not to sleep and other good stuff
