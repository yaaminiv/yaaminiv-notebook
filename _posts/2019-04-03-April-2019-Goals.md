It's cherry blossom season! Which also means I'm back from vacation and it's time to set some new goals.

### [March Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/March-2019-Goals/):

**Virginica**:

- Things went a little differently than I thought they would. Instead of doing gene product descriptions, I [visualized DML and DMR](https://yaaminiv.github.io/DML-Analysis-Part26/) to understand [discrepancies in my data](https://yaaminiv.github.io/DML-Analysis-Part27/).
- Created a [revised 5x coverage DML track](https://yaaminiv.github.io/DML-Analysis-Part28/) and characterized location of DML
- [Described general methylation trends](https://yaaminiv.github.io/DML-Analysis-Part29/)
- Updated methods and results

**Gigas Broodstock**:

- Putting this on hold until I can figure out how to deal with low-volume samples

**Other**:

- [Quantified extracted sperm DNA](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Sperm-Extractions-Part5/)
- Added Jackie to my committee

### April Goals

**Virginica**:

- Revise methods and results for general methylation and DML descriptions
- Modify [paper repo](https://github.com/epigeneticstoocean/paper-gonad-meth/tree/master/code) so analysis is easily reproducible
- Conduct gene-level analysis
- Sort out issues with DMR and `methylKit`
- Draft full paper

**Virginica Sperm**:

- Identify samples for RNA-Seq
- Extract DNA from mantle samples
- Do MBD for sperm and mantle DNA

**Other**:

- Find GSR
- Schedule new committee meeting
