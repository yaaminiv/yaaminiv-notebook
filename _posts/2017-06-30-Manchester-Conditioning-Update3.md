Overall notes:

- Feeding needs to be increased to a point where the water is dark and the oysters are not clearing it
  - Start with 700 mL Reed's paste in 200 L of water, and increase by 50 mL until water is the desired color
  - Laura will take care of feeding on 7/1/17 and 7/3/17, and I'll be back on 7/5/17 to check on it
- Dosing rate is 55%-60%
- Temperatures indicated are desired, will need to adjust heaters and check AVTECH accordingly
- Tanks should be vacuumed daily, and drained and cleaned at least once a week
- If oysters start dying
  - Hold temperature for at least one day
  - Feed 100 mL more Reed's
  - Resume temperature conditioning after 1-2 days (handler's discretion)
- After 7/15/17, oysters should no longer be drained and cleaned
