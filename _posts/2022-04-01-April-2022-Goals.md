So turns out it's April and I feel like Daniel Radcliffe.

### [March Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/March-2022-Goals/)

**Gigas Gonad Methylation**:

- Submitted the manuscript! Had a few back-and-forth QC requests but last I checked reviewers have been contacted. A [version is available on bioRXiv](http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2022.03.07.483338).

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

- Extracted a batch of test samples and sent them for preliminary sequencing

**Killifish Methylation and Expression**:

- [Tested mapping code on a subset of samples](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Killifish-Hypoxia-RRBS-Part3/)
- [Determined that mapping should be done non-directionally](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Killifish-Hypoxia-RRBS-Part4/)
- The corrupted sample couldn't be fixed, so I [proceeded with the full sample mapping without that sample](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Killifish-Hypoxia-RRBS-Part5/)!

**Virginica Methylation and Expression**:

- Worked on `mixOmics` SPLS and finished the analysis for all samples
- Started sex-specific SPLS, but kept running into a specific code issue
- Didn't get a chance to update any of the methods and results

**Other**:

- Still working on that ocean acidification and reproduction review...
- Submitted eelgrass transcriptomics abstract, and it was accepted immediately!
- Discussed zebrafish project logistics with Neel
- Coordinated the pre-application postdoctoral mentoring program
- Didn't apply to any positions because I found out I got the NSF PRFB!

### April Goals

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

- Evaluate next steps for the project

**Killifish Methylation and Expression**

- Finish full sample mapping
- Extract methylation and filter methylation calls
- Determine how to conduct analysis of DMR with multiple factors (population and hypoxia)

**Zebrafish DNMT**:

- Identify a stress condition to use for the zebrafish based on disease factors or conditions that are known to induce changes in methylation
- Determine physiological endpoints to assess for embryos
- Construct a project timeline

**Virginica Methylation and Expression**:

- Update methods
- Update foundational results
- Continue working through sex-specific SPLS

**Other**:

- Think about potential components for silverside project
- Send out postdoctoral mentorship survey
- Coordinate pre-application postdoctoral mentoring program
- Apply to any relevant faculty positions or funding opportunities

### Deep Freeze

Things that are not immediate enough to be on the backburner, so they're stuck in the deep freeze.

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

Once the reproduction review and eelgrass paper are in a stable state, I can start thinking about this paper again.

- Address Rajan's edits
- Review `DSS` script and determine if I should go back to `methylKit` for better interpretation
- Extract SNPs with `EpiDiverse` and create a relatedness matrix
- Look at methylation islands and non-methylated regions
- Examine overlaps between DML and other epigenomic datasets from Sascha
