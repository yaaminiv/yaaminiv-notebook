## Trouble struck at 8:16 p.m. on January 28.

I checked the progress of the mass spectrometry analysis on TeamViewer and saw that the blank that had just finished running had the weirdest looking raw data.

*Cue the horrible iPhone photos used in text conversations induced with slight panic*

For reference, the previous blanks looked like this:

I checked the previous sample, just to make sure nothing went wrong. It looked fine!

The pressure also looked fine.

So I checked the current sample that was running, and it was also doing something wonky in the midst of data collection.

I talked with Emma and she agreed to check the progress in about 45 minutes in case things had changed.

*45 minutes later...*

The data collection seemed to be going smoothly, so I agreed to check the sample when it was done. If the blank that runs after that sample looked weird, or if the sample looked weird, then I would clear the active queue and stop running the samples.

*1 hour later...*

When I checked the sample again, data was collected, but it didn't seem to fully collect in the left tail of the distribution. Emma believes that there was a bubble in the column, so I will run this sample again.

The current blank also seemed like it would follow the pattern of previous blanks, so all is good! 

*The next morning...*

Laura and I added 60 ÂµL of ACN to the blank tube just in case. Everything ran smoothly overnight, so fingers crossed there are no more bubbles in the column!
