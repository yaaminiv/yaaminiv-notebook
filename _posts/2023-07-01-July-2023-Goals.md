I keep thinking that after each chaotic week of this experiment, that the next week is the one that will bring a stable routine and a chance to do something that isn't mess around with live animals all day. Not that live animals are bad, but I sure do miss my computer. I'll (obviously) re-evaluate this statement in February when I'm tired of staring at a screen.

Spoiler alert: I'll be nostalgic for experimental chaos!

### [June Goals recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/June-2023-Goals/)

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- Sent my samples for metabolomics and lipidomics sequencing!!
- Started the respirometry data analysis! Not done yet, but my preliminary results show that there is a point to doing respirometry...and that's pretty darn exciting.

**West Coast Green Crab Experiment**:

- [Set up ESL and bought all necessary experimental materials](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2023-Part4/)
- [Receive the Washington crabs](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2023-Part5/)!! Measured, labelled, and took leg joints for genotyping for all the crabs with the help of an amazing crew.
- Managed to [start the treatments](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2023-Part7/) after a grueling few days at ESL!

**Summer Students**:

- Finalized summer projects for Lauren and Julia
- Julia got a (much-needed) extension on her thesis proposal so Carolyn and I have more time to write her letter of support

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

- [Started revising my previous `methylKit` results](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Hawaii-Gigas-Methylation-Analysis-Part22/)! Then the experiment got extremely chaotic and I paused this work.

### July Goals

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- Seriously actually finish the respirometry analysis

**West Coast Green Crab Experiment**:

- Just. keep. swimming.

**Summer Students**:

- Write Julia's letter of support for her proposal
- Assist students with their independent projects and analysis
- Introduce students to other people they can network with at WHOI
- Help students write an abstract for a conference of their choice

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

- Rework analysis with additional dataset
- Re-try KOG analysis
- Dig into gene lists
- Start discussion

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

- Add Rajan's edits as comments to the draft manuscript
- Finish `methylKit` contingency tests
- Conduct a randomization test for DML identification
- Integrate with other epigenetic datasets
- Update methods and results

**Other**:

- Review paper for Evolutionary Applications
- Review paper for Aquaculture
- Start draft of Evolution Symposium
- Revise CV
- Revise research statement
- Revise teaching statement

### Deep Freeze

Things that are not immediate enough to be on the backburner, so they're stuck in the deep freeze.

**Virginica Methylation and Expression**:

I'll return to this when I have an updated discussion for the Hawaii paper.

- Update methods and results from quadratic addition to transcriptional noise model
- Compare transcriptional noise analysis with Liew and Aranda papers

**Killifish Methylation and Expression**:

I'll return to this when I have a good draft of the coral paper.

- Pathway analysis for RNA-Seq data
- Determine protocol for SNP identification
- Conduct in silico RRBS digestion
- Characterize DEG that overlap between populations
- Quantify gene expression variability
- Visualize DEG data

**Zebrafish DNMT**:

I'll think about this once I have a robust killifish paper draft.

- Identify a stress condition to use for the zebrafish based on disease factors or conditions that are known to induce changes in methylation
- Determine physiological endpoints to assess for embryos
- Construct a project timeline
