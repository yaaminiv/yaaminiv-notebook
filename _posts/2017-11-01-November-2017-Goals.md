This might be the first time I actually acheived all of my goals. Either I became super productive this month, learned to set reasonable goals, or just didn't have many of them........

**October Goals Recap**:

- I [removed bad samples](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Correlating-Technical-Replicates-Part9/) from my dataset after trying lots of different methods, and now I have [boxplots characterizing protein expression](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Correlating-Technical-Replicates-Part10/) across different sites and habitats I kind of trust! :relaxed:
- Didn't make much progress writing since I was mainly troubleshooting my data
- Submitted a NSF GRFP proposal :tada:
- Hosted my [first committee meeting](https://yaaminiv.github.io/First-Committee-Meeting/)! Got most of my paperwork signed, and I'm just waiting for final approval on my proposal so I can turn everything in
- I didn't make any direct strides to tailoring my WSN presentation, but fixing my analyses is a good start. I also signed up to give a talk at GSS the week before WSN
- Didn't even touch anything metaanalysis or Manchester related

**November Goals**:
- Turn in all of my milestone paperwork (Notification of Committe Formation, Plan of Study, Thesis Proposal)
- Present at GSS and WSN
- Have a [complete paper draft](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1giP16iXWPE7oDSNI7fyLV3p_1jqsXuuxlH7cJQAwhLM/edit#heading=h.7vvlns7jaib) by the end of the month! :open_mouth:
  - Week 1 (November 1-November 5)
    - GET DATA FROM DNR
      - pH, DO, temperature, salinity, growth
      - See if they have primary productivity data, or if I can get that myself
    - Analyses 
      - Enhance SRM pipeline
      - Repeat NMDS/ANOSIM with new dataset
      - See if I can pool eelgrass with bare samples
    - Writing 
      - Revise SRM methods
  - Week 2 (November 6-November 12)
    - Analyses
      - Use GIS to show that I have a broad spectrum of conditions between my sites
      - Connect protein expression to environmental data
      - Investigate alternative splicing
      - Use individual as a random effect for analyses
    - Writing
      - Revise DIA results
  - Week 3 (November 13-November 19)
    - Analyses
      - ROC curves
      - Create DIA document
    - Writing
      - Write SRM results
      - Outline Discussion
  - Week 4 (November 20-November 26)
    - Writing
      - Write Discussion
      - Outline Introduction
  - Week 5 (November 27-November 30)
    - Writing
      - Write Introduction
      - Revise manuscript
      
If you'll excuse me, I need to get started on that massive to-do list.
