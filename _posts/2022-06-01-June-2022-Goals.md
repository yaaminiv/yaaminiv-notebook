This past month was spent juggling analyses and experimental set-ups: an endless conveyor belt of work. But I'd like to think I was more successful than Lucy and Ethel because I feel good about the progress I made!

### [May Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/May-2022-Goals/)

**Killifish Methylation and Expression**

- [Troubleshooted my `BAT_overview`](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Killifish-Hypoxia-RRBS-Part11/) and [`BAT_DMRcalling`](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Killifish-Hypoxia-RRBS-Part14/) issues!
- [Identified DMR](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Killifish-Hypoxia-RRBS-Part15/) and [revised DMR identification without L4 samples](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Killifish-Hypoxia-RRBS-Part17/)
- [Characterized the general methylation landscape](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Killifish-Hypoxia-RRBS-Part16/)
- Update methods and results for methylation dataset
- Didn't start RNA-Seq analysis since Neel and I decided that I could use the analysis he already did for preliminary results, and I could redo both the RNA-Seq and RRBS analyses with the new genome later

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- Got space in ESL for my experiment!
- After much struggle, determined that the cold box could hold temperature at 5ºC ± 2ºC
- Slowly started putting together the experimental tanks, air lines, and heaters
- Worked with Chris to find a time to learn respirometry
- Reworked the experimental timeline and decided on a tentative start timeframe

**Virginica Methylation and Expression**:

- [Updated foundational methylation dataset methods and results](https://yaaminiv.github.io/CEABiGR-Part3/)
- Didn't return to SPLS and worked on [transcriptional noise analysis with Shelly](https://yaaminiv.github.io/CEABiGR-Part4/)

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

- Came up with a project plan with Maggie!

**Other**:

- Got SO CLOSE to submitting the reproduction review
- Finished my work with the eelgrass paper
- Extended the mentorship experiences survey deadline to get additional responses

### June Goals

**Killifish Methylation and Expression**:

- Finalize DMR identification and annotation
- Integrate RRBS and RNA-Seq analysis
- Start RRBS mapping with new genome
- Update methods and results

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- Finish experimental set up
- Complete respiration trial and obtain any necessary materials
- Finalize experiment start date
- Obtain crabs and crab food

**Virginica Methylation and Expression**:

- Finish transcriptional noise analysis
- Return to SPLS
- Determine which hypothesis-driven analyses from the workshop should be incorporated into the paper or redone

**Other**:

- Submit reproduction review paper
- Distribute results of postdoctoral mentorship experiences survey
- Launch the postdoctoral mentoring program
- Apply for any relevant faculty positions or funding opportunities

### Deep Freeze

Things that are not immediate enough to be on the backburner, so they're stuck in the deep freeze.

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

Once I finish my preliminary killifish analysis, I will work on this.

- Conduct preliminary Tag-Seq differential expression analysis

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

Once the reproduction review and eelgrass paper are submitted, I can start thinking about this paper again.

- Address Rajan's edits
- Return to `methylKit` for better interpretation
- Extract SNPs with `EpiDiverse` and create a relatedness matrix
- Look at methylation islands and non-methylated regions
- Examine overlaps between DML and other epigenomic datasets from Sascha

**Zebrafish DNMT**:

I'll think about this once I finish my pilot experiment.

- Identify a stress condition to use for the zebrafish based on disease factors or conditions that are known to induce changes in methylation
- Determine physiological endpoints to assess for embryos
- Construct a project timeline
