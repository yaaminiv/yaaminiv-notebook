What last-minute panic is better than end-of-the-year panic?! I've got 17 days of time in Seattle before heading back to California for a bit of a break, so let's see if my work expectations will actually meet my reality.

### **[November Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/November-2020-Goals/)**

**Virginica Labwork**:

- Started [checking DNA](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Virginica-Gonad-DNA-Extractions-Part8/) and [RNA quality](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Virginica-Gonad-DNA-Extractions-Part7/), but found out shortly after I started the process that I didn't need to do that!
- [Re-extracted DNA (and RNA) from two low-yield female samples](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Virginica-Gonad-DNA-Extractions-Part9/)
- [Identified a protocol for sperm samples but did not test it](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/1040)

**Coral Methylation Comparison**:

- [Calculated genome-wide methylation](https://yaaminiv.github.io/MethCompare-Part28/), but didn't finalize contingency tests or the manuscript

**Other**:

- Submitted the NSF PRFB!
- Finalized ocean acidification and reproduction reivew for friendly reviewers!

### December Goals

**Virginica Labwork**:

- Extract sperm DNA and RNA
- Send nucleic acids for library preparation
- Determine if there are mantle samples I want to extract

**ATAC-Seq Labwork**:

- Purchase reagents and identify samples to test cell dissociation protocols
- Ensure protocol is easy to follow and is accessible for the lab
- Dissociate and cryopreserve some cells

**Gigas Labwork**:

- If there's some lag time while waiting for ATAC-Seq reagents, test RNA extraction protocol
- Extract RNA from samples sent for WGBS
- Send RNA for library preparation and sequencing
- Identify location of larval samples for potential extractions

**Coral Methylation Comparison**:

- Perform contingency tests for genomic location
- Update methods and results
- Contribute to the discussion
- Finalize manuscript for NOAA internal review!
