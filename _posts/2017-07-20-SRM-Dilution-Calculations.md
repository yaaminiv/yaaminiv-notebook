title: SRM Dilution Calculations
---

## My prior calculations were incorrect!

As I mentioned [previously](https://yaaminiv.github.io/SRM-Assay-Day9/), Laura and I need to run dilutions of our samples to confirm that as the concentration of protein in our samples decreases, the assay does not detect them as intensely. When I showed Emma my calculations, she suggested making dilutions based on protein concentrations (µg) as opposed to µL of sample added. Here are my final numbers:

**Table 1**. Dilution calculations

| **Vial** | **Dilution Ratio** | **µg to Inject** | **µL to Inject** | **µg oyster Needed** | **µg geoduck Needed** | **µL oyster needed ((µg/µL)x15 µL/1 µg/µL)** | **µL geoduck needed ((µg/µL)x15 µL/2 µg/µL)** | **PRTC added** | **µL  ACN** | **Total Volume (µL)** |

For PRTC, our stock concentration volume is 0.5 pmol/µL. I changed the injection volume for the 10:1 and 1:10 dilutions from 2 µL to 1 µL to ensure we were pipetting volumes over 0.5 µL. This made it so that the final volume for the 10:1 injection was 15.75 µL, but Emma said that was okay.
