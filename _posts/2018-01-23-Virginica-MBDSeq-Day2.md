## A fulfilling day of labwork!

JK.

This morning I was prepared to start my labwork, but when I talked to Sam about my time restrictions for the day, we both decided it would be better to start working tomorrow instead. I went through the [MethylMiner](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/blob/master/protocols/Commercial_Protocols/Invitrogen_MethylMiner_Manual.pdf) protocol and calculated the amount of DNA I would need from each sample, and the amount of a 1X Wash/Buffer needed for tomorrow. You can find my calculations [here](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-oyster-oa/blob/master/analyses/Virginica_MBDSeq_20180123/2018-01-23-MBDSeq-Labwork/2018-01-23-Virginica-MBDSeq-Labwork-Calculations.xlsx).

Tomorrow's work entails preparing the beads that bind to the DNA. I need to wash the beads, then bind the MBD-Biotin protein to them. Finally, I'll incubate the beads and protein to my sample DNA overnight. I'm ready to get started!
