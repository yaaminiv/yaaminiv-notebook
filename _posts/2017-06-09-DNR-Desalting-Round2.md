title: DNR Desalting Round 2
---

## Last day of DNR extractions (hopefully)!

Grace and Kaitlyn helped me desalt the [samples I speed vacuumed on Saturday, June 3](https://yaaminiv.github.io/DNR-Speed-Vacuum-Round2/). For the most part, I followed my [protocol from December](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Desalting/), adjusting the volume of final solvent needed at the end to accomodate for the 100 µg/100 µL protein samples I had.

### **Reagents required**:
Reagents were made by Jose using the [following protocol](https://github.com/sr320/LabDocs/blob/master/protocols/ProteinprepforMSMS.md) on June 6.

- Solvent A = 60% acetonitrile + 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (300ul/sample)
- Solvent B = 5% acetonitrile + 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (500ul/sample)
- Final Solvent = 3% acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid (100ul/sample)
- 10% formic acid

### Step 1: Label centrifuge tubes and columns

- For each sample to be desalted, label 2 centrifuge tubes and two macrospin column tubes
 - Centrifuge tubes: L1 and L2 (ex. O04 L1 and O04 L2)
 - Columns: A and B (ex. O04 A and O04 B)

### Step 2: Reconstitute samples

- Added 100 µL Solvent B to each sample
- For sample O122, did the following
 - Tested to see if sample is at pH 2
 - If not, added 50 µL 10% formic acid
 - Vortexed sample lightly to thoroughly mix solution
 - Tested pH again
 - Added additional 50 µL 10% formic acid
 - Vortexed and tested pH
 - Added final 50 µL of 10% formic acid (total formic acid added: 150 µL)
 - Vortexed and tested pH. It was at pH 2
- Added 150 µL 10% formic acid to remaining samples

Jose told us that he needed 150 µL of 10% formic acid to get his samples to the desired pH. This was the same volume I used in December for my samples. We also needed 150 µL 10% formic acid per sample. Ideally, I would have tested the pH of all samples. However, we were out of pH strips, so I could only test 2.

### Step 3: **Wash columns**:
- Took 1 set of 11 Macropsin columns
 - Removed caps from top and bottom of columns
 - Placed columns in set of collection tubes labelled "A"
- Added 200 µL of Solvent A to each column
- Spun columns for 3 minutes at 2000 rpm
 - Repeated 3 more times for a total for 4 spins
 - Discarded remaining liquid in column every other spin to accomodate additional liquid

### Step 4: **Equilibrate columns**:
- Added 200 µL of Solvent B to each column
- Spun columns for 3 minutes at 2000 rpm
 - Repeated 2 more times for a total of 3 spins
 - Discarded remaining liquid in column after the second and third spin to accomodate additional liquid
 
During this step, I spilled a small amount (a few specks) of salt from columns O04 A and O131 A. There also seemed to be a bubble in the column of O106 A.

### Step 5: **Load protein on columns**:
- Vortexed samples with protein digest once more to thoroughly mix solution
- Added 30 µg of protein digest to each column
 - Pipetted total volume of liquid in sample snaptop centrifuge tube into the associated column
 - ex. "O07 MT" (snaptop centrifuge tube with protein digest) --> "O07 A" (collection tube with column)
- Spun columns for 3 minutes at 3000 rpm
- Pipetted liquid that flowed through column
- Put flow-through back on column
- Spun columns again for 3 minutes at 3000 rpm
 - **Peptides are now in the columns**
- Transfered remaining liquid to the first set of previously labelled snaptop centrifuge tubes
 - ex. "O07 A" (collection tube with column) --> "O07 L1" (snaptop centrifuge tube for liquid flow-through)
- Store snaptop centrifuge tubes in -80ºC freezer

### Step 6: **Wash salts through columns**:
- Added 200 µL of Solvent B to each column
- Spun columns for 3 minutes at 3000 rpm
 - Repeated 2 more times for a total of 3 spins
- Transfered remaining liquid to the second set of previously labelled snaptop centrifuge tubes
 - ex. "O07 A" (collection tube with column) --> "O07 L2" (snaptop centrifuge tube for liquid flow-through)
- Stored snaptop centrifuge tubes in -80ºC freezer

Small specks of salt spilled from columns O14 A and O100 A. Additionally, Grace and I had a miscommunication and all columns associated with [Round 2 samples](https://yaaminiv.github.io/DNR-Sample-Preparation-Round2/) were spun a total of four times instead of three. I don't believe this will affect my peptide results, as they are washed out of the columns with Solvent A, not Solvent B.

### Step 7: **Elute peptides**:
- Transfered column contents to the second set of previously labelled Macrospin columns
 - ex. "O07 A" (collection tube with column) --> "O07 B" (new collection tube with column)
- Added 100 µL of Solvent A to each column
- Spun columns for 3 minutes at 3000 rpm
 - Repeated 1 more time for a total of 2 spins
 - **Peptides are now in the liquid**
- Disposed of columns and keep collection tubes with liquid

### Step 8: **Evaporate peptides**:
- Using speed vacuum, evaporate samples to near dryness at 25ºC
- Speed vacuum start time: 4 p.m.

The original protocol states that this step should be done at 4ºC, but Emma said we could do it at 25ºC. This shortened our speed vacuuming time.

**Table 1**. Times samples were removed from the speed vacuum.

|:-------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| **4:49 p.m.** | O01, O04, O06, O10, O14, O17, O21, O24, O26, O31, O35, O40, O43, O46, O49, O51, O56, O60, O64, O71, O101, O103, O173 |

| **5:08 p.m.** |               O08, O30, O32, O39, O52, O66, O90, O96, O100, O102, O106, O128, O140, O145, O147, OBLNK2               |
| **5:17 p.m.** |                                                          O22                                                         |
| **5:33 p.m.** |                                              O91, O99, O121, O122, O131                                              |

### Step 9: **Reconsitute peptides**:
- Added 100 µL of final solvent to each column
- Lighty vortexed all samples
- Centrifuged all samples down
- Stored samples in -80ºC freezer

For the most part, I'm all set for our July 10 mass spectrometry date!
