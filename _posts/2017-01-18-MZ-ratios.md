## M/Z ratios: Mass hysteria ensues

Before we run our samples on the mass spectrometer, we need to know what mass-to-charge ratios (m/z ratios) to use. By looking at the output m/z ratios of previous runs, we can assess which range to use. To do this, I examined Rhonda's larval *Crassostrea gigas* mass spectrometer results.

Previous runs were generally saved on Emma's database, which allows the user to search mass spectrometer output using a handy web interface. However, Rhonda's data is saved on our lab computer [Emu](https://github.com/sr320/LabDocs/wiki/Lab-Software#computer-emu). This made the process of extracting and manipulating the files I needed convoluted. With some lab teamwork, we figured it out!

#### **Here's the final protocol**:

- Using [this R script](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-oyster-oa/blob/master/analyses/MZratios_larval_samples/MZratios-larval-samples.R), I randomly selected 10 of Rhonda's samples to work with. The files I need to work with are the ones named "interact..pep.xml"
- I used the following code to manipulate the `pep.xml` file of interest. The code manipulates TPP viewer through the command line and allows me to export the data file as an `.xls` document.
 `/usr/tpp_install/tpp/cgi-bin/PepXMLViewer.cgi -C Pprobability,Gspectrum,Sexpect,Gions,Gpeptide,GMZratio,Gcalc_neutral_pep_mass,Gprotein -B exportSpreadsheet 1 -I /path/to/pep.xml/file`
- I then used the following code to copy the files from Emu to my local machine
 `scp srlab@128.95.149.195:~/Documents/rhonda/path/to/pep.xls/file /Users/yaaminivenkataraman/Desktop`
- In the [R script](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-oyster-oa/blob/master/analyses/MZratios_larval_samples/MZratios-larval-samples.R) I merged all the `.xls` files and created a histogram depicting the frequency of m/z ratios in the samples.

**Figure 1. Frequency of m/z ratios from Rhonda's samples**

In the histogram, I can see that the majority of my peptides have m/z ratios between 450 and 950. Based on this information, Emma will set the range for my mass spectrometer runs.
