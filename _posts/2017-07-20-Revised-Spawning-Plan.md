title: Revised Spawning Plan

## Featuring reduced crosses and pools

After showing Steven and Brent my [preliminary spawning plan](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Preliminary-Spawning-Plan/), I used their feedback and Joth's comments from the July hatchery update meeting to make a revised plan. I was also able to think through the actual steps of spawning and materials needed for this plan because I shadowed a *C. gigas* spawn at Taylor Shellfish on Monday.

### Crosses and pools

Here are the current oyster counts in my conditioning tanks.

**Table 1**. Oyster counts in each tank.

|  Tag Label |  A |  B | Total |
|:----------:|:--:|:--:|:-----:|
|      1     |  7 |  9 |   16  |
|      2     |  8 |  8 |   16  |
|      3     |  6 |  6 |   12  |
|      4     |  6 |  7 |   13  |
|      5     |  9 |  8 |   17  |
|      6     |  5 |  8 |   13  |
| Heat Shock |  5 |  6 |   11  |

Assuming there is a 50/50 sex ratio, I calculated the number of males and females I'd have from each tank. I assumed I would have more males than females, just for the numbers.

**Table 2**. Sex ratios for each tank. 

|  Tag Label |  M |  F | Total |
|:----------:|:--:|:--:|:-----:|
|      1     |  8 |  8 |   16  |
|      2     |  8 |  8 |   16  |
|      3     |  6 |  6 |   12  |
|      4     |  7 |  6 |   13  |
|      5     |  9 |  8 |   17  |
|      6     |  7 |  6 |   13  |
|  Subtotal  | 45 | 43 |   88  |
| Heat Shock |  6 |  5 |   11  |
|    Total   | 51 | 48 |   99  |

To make my crosses, I will pool all of the eggs from my six tanks and from the heat shock treatment. Keeping males separate, I will cross all of the males from Tanks 1-6 with the females from Tanks 1-6. Separately, I will cross the heat shock oysters with eachother. **Therefore, I will have (45 males)*(6 egg pools) + (6 males)*(1 egg pool) = 276 crosses**.

After measuring hatch rate for each cross, 24 hours post-fertilization, I will pool hatched D-hinge larvae from each cross according to Table 3.

**Table 3**. Treatment pools for crosses.

| **Pool** |    **Parent 1**   |   **Parent 2**  | **Parent 1 Tank** | **Parent 2 Tank** |
|:--------:|:-----------------:|:---------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|
|   **1**  |   Low pH Female   | Ambient pH Male |     Tanks 1-3     |     Tanks 4-6     |
|   **2**  | Ambient pH Female |   Low pH Male   |     Tanks 4-6     |     Tanks 1-3     |
|   **3**  |   Low pH Female   |   Low pH Male   |     Tanks 1-3     |     Tanks 1-3     |
|   **4**  | Ambient pH Female | Ambient pH Male |     Tanks 4-6     |     Tanks 4-6     |
|   **5**  | Heat Shock Female | Heat Shock Male |  Heat Shock Tank  |  Heat Shock Tank  |

Once pooled, I will count the number of live and dead larvae in each pool. Based on these counts, I will calculate how many larvae I need to add to each bucket to get a density of 1/2 larvae per mL. I will then redistribute larvae into the static system.

### Static system description

For the static system, I want to keep larvae in five gallon buckets. Each pool listed in Table 3 will have five replicates, meaning I need 25 buckets total. Buckets will be placed in larger totes with water and immersion heaters to keep water temperature at 25 ÂºC for the larval period. I think five buckets will fit nicely into a tote, but I need to check. I'm planning on keeping the totes on the middle table where Laura had her buckets.

### Spawning steps

**Day 1**: 

- Shuck and sex all oysters
- Dry strip viable oysters
- IF NO COULTER COUNTER: Pool eggs together
  - Use equal weights of gonads from multiple females
- Screen eggs using 80 and 20 micron screens
- Hydrate eggs
- IF COULTER COUNTER: Count number of eggs needed for fertilization
- Collect amount of sperm necessary for fertilization
  - Hydrate sperm
  - Examine under a microscope
- Fertilize eggs
  - One tripour per cross

**Day 2**:

- Calculate hatch rate
- Pool alike treatments based on Table 3
- Calculate pool densities
- Redistribute larvae to static system
  - Five gallon buckets in totes
  - Five replicates/pool
  - 1/2 larvae per mL

### Materials needed

- Shucking knives: 4
- Oyster separators: Enough to hold 200 oysters
- Glass capilary tubes: 150
- Tripours: ~300
- Scoring knives: 4
- Spatulas: 4
- Microscope: 1
- 80 micron screens: 2
- 20 micron screens: 2
- 5 gallon buckets: 50
- Totes: 8
- Immersion heaters: 6

### Questions

- Should I try and separate crosses between conditioning tanks (Tank A and Tank B)? I've had more mortalities in Tank A.
- Should I include Ambient x Heat shock crosses?
- Are we rearing larvae in a static system for the full duration, or are we going to switch to a flow-through at 100 microns?

### Ask Molly and/or Rhonda

- How to calculate the amount of sperm and egg to use when fertilizing
- An easy way to calculate hatch rate
