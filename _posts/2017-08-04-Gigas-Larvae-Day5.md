title: Gigas Larvae Day 5
---

## Lots of maintenance today

Aside from daily feeding, I don't have much urgent work on days I don't screen and count. I used my off day to get my system fully set up and catch up on counting larvae from [my first screening](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Gigas-Larvae-Day2/).

**What I did today**:

- Recorded which [tote](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-oyster-oa/blob/master/data/Manchester/2017-07-30-Pacific-Oyster-Larvae/2017-07-31-Temperature.xlsx) each tank was in
- Wireless monitoring
  - I have four AVTECHs available for my larvae: Temp 1, Temp 4, WISH 9 Ext 1 and WISH 9 Ext 2. Temp 3 is for my heating header tank
  - Changed names on OA Monitor Dashboard on GoToMyDevices and placed in totes
    - Temp 1 = Gigas-Larvae-1 = Tote 5
    - Temp 2 = Gigas-Larvae-2 = Tote 1
    - WISH 9 Ext 1 = Gigas-Larvae-3 = Tote 7
    - WISH 9 Ext 2 = Gigas-Larvae-4 = Tote 9
    - Temp 3 = Gigas-Larvae-Header
  - Labelled AVTECHs with tape so I knew which one was which
  - Set up alerts if temperature gets above 27ºC or below 22ºC
- Decided against relabelling HOBOs because I didn't want the Sharpie to leech into the water. This is something I need to think of an alternative for
- Set high (27ºC) and low (24ºC) temperature alarms on immersion heaters
- Flushed header and heated line
  - Turned off all heaters
  - Removed and cleaned Rick's heater
  - Added a third heater to replace Rick's
  - Drained header tank and flushed heated line
  - Refilled header tank
  - Heated water
- Fed Joth's scallops
- Cleaned tripours for Saturday screening
- Replaced PSRF's blue screens with green screens
- Counted [Plate 2 and 3](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-oyster-oa/blob/master/data/Manchester/2017-07-30-Pacific-Oyster-Larvae/2017-08-02-Larvae-Counts.xlsx)
  - While I was counting Bucket 10 (Plate 2, Wells C1-C3) I found there dark blobs that were bigger than the larvae. I sent images to Rhonda and she didn't know what it was. I couldn't zoom in and make the image clear enough to take a photo, but here are the blurry images I took. I found 30 in Well C1, 38 in C2 and 18 in C3.

**Figures 1-3**. Big blobs found in Bucket 10
  - Because of this weird contamination and the fact that I [incorrectly counted Plate 1](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Gigas-Larvae-Day4/), I these data may end up being an outlier.
- [Fed larvae](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-oyster-oa/blob/master/data/Manchester/2017-07-30-Pacific-Oyster-Larvae/2017-07-30-Feeding.xlsx) a mix of Chagra, C.iso and 609. Again, the algae was really dense!
  - I fed 15 and 16 extra 100 mL of 609 and 100 mL Chagra by accident

**For tomorrow**:

- Feed Joth's csallops
- Screen and count on 60 micron screen
- Feed larvae
- Drain header tank
