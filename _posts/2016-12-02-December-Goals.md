#### My [DNR project](https://yaaminiv.github.io/DNRprojectintroduction/) is still on the brain!.

**November Goals Update**:
- Gave a talk at the Graduate Student Symposium. I think it went well!
- DNA extractions are not a priority right now

**December Goals**
- Successfully complete protein extractions for 10 DNR samples
- Figure out when DNA extractions make sense
- Apply for relevant fellowships
