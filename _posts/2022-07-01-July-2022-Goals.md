It's experiment month! I'm focusing on the green crab work for July and letting everything else be a second priority.

### [June Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/June-2022-Goals/)

**Killifish Methylation and Expression**:

- [Went through the closest genes to each DMR](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Killifish-Hypoxia-RRBS-Part18/)
- [Revised methylation landscape analysis](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Killifish-Hypoxia-RRBS-Part19/)
- Didn't have time for anything else since I was focusing on the green crab work

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- [Figured out how to manipulate temperature](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-Part2/)
- [Completed respiration trial!](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment/)
- [Finished setting up and STARTED THE EXPERIMENT](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-Part3/)

**Virginica Methylation and Expression**:

- Helped finalize the methylation analysis with DML genomic location information

**Other**:

- Submitted reproduction review paper!

### July Goals

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- Finalize respirometry and time-to-right protocols
- Continue with experiment
- Sample heart tissue for metabolomics

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

- Conduct preliminary Tag-Seq differential expression analysis in preparation for a week of in-person work with Maggie

**Killifish Methylation and Expression**:

- Test `BAT_DMRcorrelating` to match RRBS and RNA-Seq data
- Start RRBS mapping with new genome

**Virginica Methylation and Expression**:

- Finalize methylation data and results
- Determine which hypothesis-driven analyses from the workshop should be incorporated into the paper or redone based on gene expression results
- Finish transcriptional noise analysis
- Return to SPLS

**Other**:

- Distribute results of postdoctoral mentorship experiences survey
- Launch the postdoctoral mentoring program
- Apply for any relevant faculty positions or funding opportunities

### Deep Freeze

Things that are not immediate enough to be on the backburner, so they're stuck in the deep freeze.

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

Once the eelgrass paper is submitted and the Manchester paper is about to be published, I can start thinking about this paper again.

- Address Rajan's edits
- Return to `methylKit` for better interpretation
- Extract SNPs with `EpiDiverse` and create a relatedness matrix
- Look at methylation islands and non-methylated regions
- Examine overlaps between DML and other epigenomic datasets from Sascha

**Zebrafish DNMT**:

I'll think about this once I finish my pilot experiment.

- Identify a stress condition to use for the zebrafish based on disease factors or conditions that are known to induce changes in methylation
- Determine physiological endpoints to assess for embryos
- Construct a project timeline
