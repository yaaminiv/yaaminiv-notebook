## New day, new errors

[Jupyter notebook found here](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-oyster-oa/blob/master/notebooks/2017-03-07-Reconvert-mzML-Files.ipynb)

`pecanpie` ran for my one reconverted sample last night. When I checked the log files, I didn't see any remnants of the error I got last time ([missing valid MS2 data](https://genefish.wordpress.com/2017/03/04/pecan-on-roadrunner-isnt-working-correctly/)). However, there seems to be a different Percolator error this time. Not too sure what it is, so I'm having Sean look into it.

Either way, I tried opening the file in Skyline and ran into the same [error I got yesterday](https://yaaminiv.github.io/PECAN-Update-2/).

I'll update this entry as I get more information!
