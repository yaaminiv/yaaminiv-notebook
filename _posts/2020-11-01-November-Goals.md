### **[October Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/October-2020-Goals/)**

**Virginica Labwork**:

- [Tested the Zymo Microprep kit for simultaneous DNA and RNA extraction](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Virginica-Gonad-DNA-Extractions-Part2/)
- [Tweaked the protocol to increase DNA and RNA yields](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Virginica-Gonad-DNA-Extractions-Part3/)
- [Completed extractions with female gonad tissue!](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Virginica-Gonad-DNA-Extractions-Part5/)

**Gigas Gonad Labwork**:

- Ordered PAXgene kit for RNA extractions

**ATAC-Seq Labwork**:

- I'm postponing thinking about ATAC-Seq preparations until I have a better idea of what *C. virginica* and *C. gigas* samples I have left after DNA/RNA extractions

**Coral Methylation Comparison**:

- We restructured and streamlined the manuscript, but I have yet to address the specific edits and comments in my section

**Other**:

- Finalized figures for the ocean acidification and reproduction review
- Didn't get a chance to create WGCNA and GO-MWU figures for *Z. marina* analyses
- Coached two students through the NSF GRFP application process! Their final products were astounding.
- Submitted 2 postdoc applications

### November Goals

**Virginica Labwork**:

- Test Zymo Microprep kit with sperm samples
- Extract sperm DNA and RNA
- Check DNA and RNA quality
- Send nucleic acids for library preparation
- Determine if there are mantle samples I want to extract

**Gigas Labwork**:

- Test RNA extraction protocol
- Extract RNA from samples sent for WGBS
- Send RNA for library preparation and sequencing

**ATAC-Seq Labwork**:

- If all other extractions are complete, purchase reagents and identify samples to test cell dissociation protocols

**Coral Methylation Comparison**:

- Finalize manuscript for submission!

**Other**:

- Submit the NSF PRFB
- Finalize ocean acidification and reproduction reivew for friendly reviewers
- Jump back into the *Z. marina* project
- Survive
