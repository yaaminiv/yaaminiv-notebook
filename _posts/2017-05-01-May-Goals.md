#### [April Goals](https://yaaminiv.github.io/April-Goals/) Recap

I was able to focus more on my metaanalysis. I [downloaded data](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Downloading-Metaanalysis-Data/), and now I'm working on code to start my analyses. I've also made some headway refining the DNR paper and our [Skyline methods](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Skyline-Test-2/). I've also partly established a committee and submitted my abstract for PCSGA's fall conference!
