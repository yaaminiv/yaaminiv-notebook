## Treatment Days 11 through 14

### Day 11

- Checked ammonia concentrations in all tanks
  - T1: 1.0
  - T2: 0
  - T3: 8.0
  - T4: 1.0
  - T5: 0.25
  - T6: 8.0
- Cleaned all tanks, performed water change for all tanks, and added 1/2 tsp conditioner to T1, T3, T4, and T6
- 1 dead crab in T3 (female green)
- Fed ambient and warm tanks 1/4 tsp, cold tanks 1/8 tsp
- yrv_3, yrv_9, yrv_10 still recording data (saw red flashes)
- T3 and T6 temperatures similar (30-31ºC) when walking in and leaving on front control boxes. T6 back control box reading ~28ºC...need to borrow or order a replacement heater if temperature does not rise by tomorrow
- Time-to-right for seven crabs in each tank

### Day 12

- Checked ammonia concentrations in all tanks
  - T1: 1.0
  - T2: 1.0
  - T3: 8.0
  - T4: 1.0
  - T5: 1.0
  - T6: 4.0
- Cleaned all tanks, performed water change for T3 and T6, and added 1/2 tsp conditioner to all tanks
  - T6: low flow on aquarium filter, repositioned filter cartridge to improve flow
- Fed ambient and warm tanks 1/4 tsp, cold tanks 1/8 tsp
- Obtained HOBO data
  - yrv_3, yrv_4, and yrv_9 fine, yrv_10 low battery
  - T1 holding 12-13ºC, T4 holding 13.5ºC
  - T3 holding 31.5ºC, T6 holding 32.5ºC. Reduced T6 front control set point to 32ºC
- T3: observed copulation/mate guarding behavior

### Day 13

- Checked ammonia concentrations in all tanks
  - T1: 0.5
  - T2: 0.25
  - T3: 8.0
  - T4: 1.0
  - T5: 0.25
  - T6: 4.0
  - Added 1/2 tsp conditioner when ammonia ≥ 1.0
- Cleaned all tanks, performed water change for T3 and T6
- Fed ambient and warm tanks 1/4 tsp, cold tanks 1/8 tsp
- T6: 2 on top
- T2: 1 dead, M YG

### Day 14

- Checked ammonia concentrations in all tanks
  - T1: 1.0
  - T2: N/a
  - T3: 8.0
  - T4: 1.0
  - T5: N/A
  - T6: 4.0
  - Added 1/2 tsp conditioner when ammonia ≥ 1.0
  - Out of solution 2, couldn't measure ammonia in cold tanks. Added 1/2 tsp conditioner just in case
- Cleaned all tanks, performed water change for T3 and T6, and changed all filters
- T6: 2 on top
- T1: 1 dead, M O
- T3: observed copulation/mate guarding behavior, back probe out of water so I shoved it back inside. Tank seemed slightly colder than T6
- Need to prevent salting on LED light cable, it's slightly finnicky and not turning on in the morning unless I meddle wiht it

### Going forward

1. Continue with experiment
3. Check HOBOs and replace low battery loggers
2. Update protocols
3. Organize project repository and datasheets
