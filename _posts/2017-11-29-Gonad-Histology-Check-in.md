## Quick journey into Manchester world

Grace has been super busy analyzing my gonad histology data (#trumie)! She hasn't finished all gonad maturation state or sex classification yet, but here's a quick peek into what she has so far.

Her classification spreadsheet can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ObTeYRQwELWhLLdVcAzt4SWPJgtj0u2QmoAxfjgFqtw/edit#gid=0). Within this file, she made pie charts to visualize sex ratios before and after pH exposure.

**Figures 1-2**. Preliminary pre and post-OA sex ratios.

In the same file, I made some pie charts to look at gonad maturation state between treatments. She only has maturation state information for four oysters before exposure, so I made graphs for the post-exposure oysters. [When I sampled](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Manchester-Day-52/), I took ten individuals per treatment.

**Figures 3-4**. Preliminary gonad maturation states, separated by treatment.

For this week's class assignment, Steven also wanted me to generate a figure for my larval survival data. I think the one I have is sufficient for now...?
