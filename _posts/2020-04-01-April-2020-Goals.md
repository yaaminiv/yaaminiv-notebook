Now that I can't get into the lab, I'm transitioning over to writing and analysis work! Here's what I think I can accomplish this month on top of surviving a pandemic.

### **[March Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/March-2020-Goals/)**:

**Quals**:

- Took the exam!

**Other**:

- Participated in [analysis and writing retreat for coral methylation comparisons](https://yaaminiv.github.io/MethCompare-Recap/)!
- Ate, slept, didn't get coronavirus and all that jazz

### April Goals

**Virginica Gonad Methylation**:

- Review proofs from Frontiers and communicate with publishing office when necessary
- Submit press release request
- Destrand data for Katie

**Gigas and Virginica Labwork**:

- Identify clear questions to address with labwork that add something new to what we know about ocean acidification and epigenetics in oysters
- Figure out what samples I have and want to extract DNA and RNA from
- Determine benchwork methods and costs
- Determine sequencing methods and costs
- Write up methods in a manuscript format

**Coral Methylation Comparison**:

- Finalize genome feature tracks for both species, including repeats, promoter, UTR, and intergenic regions
- Rerun CpG characterization pipeline with full samples and genome feature tracks
- Figure out methylation island analysis
- Work on whatever other weekly goals we come up with

**Other**:

- Help out with FISH 441/541 class
- Look into comparative epigenomics with invertebrate data the lab has
- Update Ph.D proposal with proposed labwork
- Figure out the next steps for SAFS milestones
- Update CV, Google Scholar, ResearchGate, and ORCID profiles
