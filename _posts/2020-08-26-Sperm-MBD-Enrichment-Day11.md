## Finishing ethanol precipitations

Today I completed [the ethanol precipitations I started previously](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Sperm-MBD-Enrichment-Day10/). 

### Step 0: Prepare for precipitations

- Set up centrifuge in the 4ºC frige in FTR 213
- Obtained samples from the -20ºC freezer in FTR 209 and placed them in the 4ºC fridge in FTR 213
- Made 70% EtOH with 7 mL 100% ethanol and 3 mL DNAse free water and placed it in the -20ºC freezer in FTR 209
- Labelled tubes to save ethanol precipitation supernatant
  - sample number and "E1 Sup" (ex. 9 E1 Sup)
  - sample number and "E2 Sup" (ex. 9 E2 Sup)
  - sample number and "E3 Sup" (ex. 9 E3 Sup)
  - sample number and "EtOH Sup" (ex. 9 EtOH Sup)

### Step 1: Pellet DNA and consolidate

- For each "E1" tube
  - Centrifuged tubes for 15 minutes at 16,000 rcf at 4ºC
  - Pipetted supernatant from "E1" tube into corresponding "E1 Sup" tube without disturbing the pellet
  - Added "E2" tube contents into corresonding "E1" tube
- For each "E1" tube with "E2" supernatant
  - Centrifuged tubes for 15 minutes at 16,000 rcf at 4ºC
  - Pipetted supernatant from "E1" tube into corresponding "E2 Sup" tube without disturbing the pellet
  - Added "E3" tube contents into corresonding "E1" tube
- For each "E1" tube with "E3" supernatant
  - Centrifuged tubes for 15 minutes at 16,000 rcf at 4ºC
  - Pipetted supernatant from "E1" tube into corresponding "E3 Sup" tube without disturbing the pellet
  
### Step 2: Ethanol precipitation

- Obtain 70% EtOH and place on ice
- For each "E1 tube"
  - Added 500 µL 70% ice cold EtOH into "E1" tubes
  - Centrifuged tubes for 5 minutes at 16,000 rcf at 4ºC
  - Pipetted supernatant from "E1" tube into corresponding "EtOH Sup" tube without disturbing the pellet
  - Repeated this entire process once more for a total of two times
- Air-dried the pellet for 5 minutes
  - I avoided drying out the pellet fully as instructed by the protocol
- Resuspended DNA pellet with 25 µL Qiagen Buffer EB ([method copied from Sam's notebook](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2018/02/07/ethanol-precipitation-dna-quantification-c-virginica-mbd-dna-from-yaamini.html)) and placed samples in the -20ºC freezer in FTR 209

### Going forward

1. Measure concentration of precipitated DNA
2. Send samples for sequencing
