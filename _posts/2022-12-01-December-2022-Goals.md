Final push for the year! I made some good progress on postdoc and side projects last month, and want to continue working on postdoc projects in particular so I can have a manuscript submitted in a month or so. I (once again) have lofty goals for this month because I have too many things that feel high priority right now! Perhaps next year (yikes) I can reassess.

### [November Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/November-2022-Goals/)

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

- Ran WGCNA and GO-MWU analyses!
- Updated methods and results
- Determined next steps for project

**Killifish Methylation and Expression**:

- Decided not to continue with the new genome for now, since the sample used is from Georgia and killifish populations have high genome variability. The old genome uses a sample from Maine which is likely more similar to the samples we have.
- [Started pathway analysis but could not move forward because of missing information](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Killifish-Hypoxia-RRBS-Part23/)
- Reviewed existing lab data with Mark!

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- Met with Chris to learn about respiration data analysis
- Worked with Sara to analyze baseline demographic data by treatment and time!

**Other**:

- Reviewed supplementary material for eelgrass transcriptomics paper
- Finished applying for faculty positions

### December Goals

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

- Test OrthoFinder methods
- Obtain lists of orthologous DEG from other studies
- Update methods and results

**Killifish Methylation and Expression**:

- Determine protocol for SNP identification
- Conduct in silico RRBS digestion
- Characterize DEG that overlap between populations
- Quantify gene expression variability
- Visualize DEG data

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- Continue working with Sara on demographic data analysis
- Analyze survivorship data by treatment and sex
- Analyze time-to-right data by treatment, sex, weight, and integument color
- Update methods and results
- Determine workflow for metabolomics sample processing
- Order materials for metabolomics samples

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

- Address Rajan's edits
- Return to `methylKit` for better interpretation
- Conduct a randomization test for DML identification
- Extract SNPs with `EpiDiverse` and create a relatedness matrix
- Examine overlaps between DML and other epigenomic datasets from Sascha
- Determine a method for assessing methylation variation by copy number
- Update methods and results
- Update discussion
- Get paper ready for submission!

**Other**:

- Launch postdoc mentoring program
- Distribute postdoc mentoring survey results

### Deep Freeze

Things that are not immediate enough to be on the backburner, so they're stuck in the deep freeze.

**Virginica Methylation and Expression**:

I will revisit this paper after I finish the Hawaii paper.

- Revisit transcriptional noise analysis
- Try and recreate model from Aranda paper

**Zebrafish DNMT**:

I'll think about this once I have a robust killifish paper draft.

- Identify a stress condition to use for the zebrafish based on disease factors or conditions that are known to induce changes in methylation
- Determine physiological endpoints to assess for embryos
- Construct a project timeline
