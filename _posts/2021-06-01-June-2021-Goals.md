So...happy defense month I guess?

### [May Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/May-2021-Goals/)

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

- [Characterized the methylation landscape!](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Hawaii-Gigas-Methylation-Analysis-Part15/)
- [Identified DML with `methylKit`](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Hawaii-Gigas-Methylation-Analysis-Part14/), and [separately with `DSS`!](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Hawaii-Gigas-Methylation-Analysis-Part17/)
- [Filtered my SNPs to only retain unique C/T SNPs](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Hawaii-Gigas-Methylation-Analysis-Part16/)
- [Determined genomic location of DML, and overlaps between `methylKit` DML and SNPs](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Hawaii-Gigas-Methylation-Analysis-Part16/), and did the [same for `DSS` DML!](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Hawaii-Gigas-Methylation-Analysis-Part17/)
- I decided that using the `EpiDiverse/snp` workflow to identify SNPs was lower priority, so I didn't tackle that
- [I tried starting functional annotation for the Roslin genome, but encountered some struggles along the way](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Hawaii-Gigas-Methylation-Analysis-Part18/). I should be able to resolve this quickly (hopefully)
- I don't have a complete manuscript, but I have been diligently updating my methods and results with each analysis.

**Gigas Gonad Methylation**:

- [Generated genome feature tracks for the Roslin genome!](https://yaaminiv.github.io/WGBS-Analysis-Part25/)
- [Characterized the methylation landscape](https://yaaminiv.github.io/WGBS-Analysis-Part26/)
- [Determine genomic location of DML](https://yaaminiv.github.io/WGBS-Analysis-Part27/) and [overlaps with SNP data](https://yaaminiv.github.io/WGBS-Analysis-Part28/)
- [I tried running randomization tests on `mox`, but was not successful](https://yaaminiv.github.io/WGBS-Analysis-Part29/). I think I identified `mc.cores` as the issue, and will report this to `methylKit`
- Kept updating the methods and results of my paper!

**Other**:

- Establish a dissertation reading committee
- Finish all work on the ocean acidification and reproduction review

### June Goals

AKA rolling over May Goals that were rolled over from April...that were rolled over from March. One day I'll learn how to set reasonable goals!

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

- Extract SNPs from bisulfite sequencing data with `EpiDiverse`
- Identify significantly enriched GOterms associated with DML
- Identify methylation islands and non-methylated regions
- Finalize figures and statistical analyses
- Have a complete initial manuscript!
- Send completed manuscript to my dissertation reading committee no later than the end of the quarter!

**Gigas Gonad Methylation**:

- Identify significantly enriched GOterms associated with DML
- Identify methylation islands and non-methylated regions
- Finalize figures and statistical analyses
- Have a complete initial manuscript!
- Send completed manuscript to my dissertation reading committee no later than the end of the quarter!
- Decide if it's worth extracting gonad RNA for integrated RNA-Seq and methylation analyses

**Other**:

- Finish all work on the ocean acidification and reproduction review
- Present at Chew Series seminar
- Draft defense talk for feedback from the lab
- **DEFEND!**
- Pass out for approximately six days
