Back on the explicit goal setting train! I'm trying a new thing where I actually make progress on all of my projects every month so I'm not stuck with too many projects in the deep freeze. Will it work out? Who knows let's find out.

### [August Goals recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/August-2023-Goals/)

...I guess this is more a recap of August, September, and October but alas here we go.

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- [Finalized respirometry analysis, including adding a Q10 analysis](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-Part19/)

**West Coast Green Crab Experiment**:

- [Shut down the 15ºC and 25ºC tanks!](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-Part16/)
- [Shut down the 5ºC tanks and finished the experiment!](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-Part17/)
- I started investigating any discrepancies in crab labelling and updating relevant spreadsheets, but I still have a couple things I need to check. That's why I haven't posted those lab notebooks yet. I want to ensure that the lab notebook posts from the end of the experiment have proper crab numbers so they're one-stop shops and not another stone in a confusing path...and if you do see working hyperlinks, that's because I finally fixed everything!
- [Conducted preliminary analysis of performance assays](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2023-Part24/)
- Extracted DNA and performed PCR for respirometry crabs
- [Genotyped respirometry crabs](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2023-Part25/)
- [Incorporated genotype into TTR and respirometry analyses](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2023-Part26/)

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

- Reworked analysis with additional dataset
- Started outlining discussion points

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

- Emailed Sascha to get other epigenetic datasets

**Other**:

- Reviewed paper for Evolutionary Applications
- Reviewed paper for Aquaculture
- Ended up not putting an Evolution Symposium together because the end of the experiment was really busy!
- Submitted SMBE IDEA Grant for RIE2 hackathon
- Revised faculty application materials
- Submitted several faculty applications
- Presented 2023 experiment physiology results at PICES!

### November Goals

I'm focusing on finishing up some projects that really needed to be finished yesterday, while also making progress on the 2022 and 2023 crab experiments.

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- Analyze metabolomics data
- Update methods and results
- Start outlining discussion points

**West Coast Green Crab Experiment**:

- Continue extracting prioritized TTR samples

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

- Re-try KOG analysis
- Dig into gene lists
- Outline discussion
- Start writing discussion

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

- Finish `methylKit` contingency tests
- Conduct a randomization test for DML identification
- Integrate other epigenetic datasets
- Update methods and results
- Revise discussion

**Other**:

- Submit faculty applications
- Re-review paper for Aquaculture
- Launch RIE2 survey
- Perform literature search for WOCinEEB Global Change collaboration

### Deep Freeze

Things that are not immediate enough to be on the backburner, so they're stuck in the deep freeze.

**Virginica Methylation and Expression**:

I'll return to this when I have an updated discussion for the Hawaii paper.

- Update methods and results from quadratic addition to transcriptional noise model
- Compare transcriptional noise analysis with Liew and Aranda papers

**Killifish Methylation and Expression**:

I'll return to this when I have a good draft of the coral paper.

- Pathway analysis for RNA-Seq data
- Determine protocol for SNP identification
- Conduct in silico RRBS digestion
- Characterize DEG that overlap between populations
- Quantify gene expression variability
- Visualize DEG data

**Zebrafish DNMT**:

I'll think about this once I have a robust killifish paper draft.

- Identify a stress condition to use for the zebrafish based on disease factors or conditions that are known to induce changes in methylation
- Determine physiological endpoints to assess for embryos
- Construct a project timeline
