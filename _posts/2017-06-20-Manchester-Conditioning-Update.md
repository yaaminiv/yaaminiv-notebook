title: Manchester Conditioning Update
---

## It's been a slow burn

As I expected, there were problems getting the heater to warm the water in the header tank fast enough to meet the [desired temperature schedule I set](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Manchester-Conditioning-Plan/). Laura mentioned that the temperature fluxuated during the day, so she was wary of increasing the temperature.

**Table 1**. Actual water temperatures read from AVTECH. Temperature listed was the peak temperature that day.
|  **Day**  |    **Date**    |   **Temperature**  |
|:---------:|:--------------:|:------------------:|
|   **6**   |     6/16/17    |      17.06 ºC      |
|   **7**   |     6/17/17    |      17.31 ºC      |
|   **8**   |     6/18/17    |      18.56 ºC      |
|   **9**   |     6/19/17    |      18.50 ºC      |

The temperature is holding around 18.5 ºC, so I increased the temperature setting on the AVTECH two degrees. My goal is to get the temperature up to 20ºC. This will only set back my conditioning timeline two days!

**Table 2**. Desired temperatures for the remainder of conditioning.
|  **Day**  |    **Date**    |   **Temperature**  |
|:---------:|:--------------:|:------------------:|
|   **10**  |     6/20/17    |        20 ºC       |
|   **11**  |     6/21/17    |        21 ºC       |
|   **12**  |     6/22/17    |        22 ºC       |
|   **13**  |     6/23/17    |        23 ºC       |
| **14-26** | 6/24/17-7/6/17 |        23 ºC       |

I'll be back on Day 13 to check on things and Laura will continue to raise the set point and check the AVTECH.
