title: Manchester Day 42
---

## I'm at NSA, to Grace and Olivia went to Manchester.

Today they proved they were listening for the past three weeks when I was at Manchester training them! They're rockstars. #success

- Water chemistry sampling: 1L grab samples and bottle samples
 - I had them do the standard curve first after Hollie gave me the same advice
 - Rick's probe was unavailable, so they used the refractometer to measure salinity in psu instead. I think the refractometer is reading values lower than either probe would because it's not as precise.
 - There was a communication mix-up over the phone, so they accidentally discarded the original water samples before measuring salninty with the refractometer. I told them to take new samples and measure salinity, since I don't expect salinity to vary greatly in the tank.
- Cleaned filters
- Bleached algal lines

Here's the data they collected:

**Figure 1**. Data collected by Olivia and Grace.

Grace said she didn't see any of that [weird stringy stuff](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Manchester-Day-36/) we saw last week in the tanks, so maybe the problem's solved? Fingers crossed.
