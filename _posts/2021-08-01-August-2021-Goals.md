I'm in crunch-mode trying to get my third and fourth chapters finalized and my full dissertation formatted! My schedule is very similar to the one above, except my writing hours don't involve writing. They involve laying on the floor and contemplating writing instead. Same thing, right?

### [July Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/July-2021-Goals/)

**Gigas Gonad Methylation**:

- [Updated manuscript with revised figures and enrichment results](https://yaaminiv.github.io/WGBS-Analysis-Part32/)
- Sent manuscript to dissertation reading committee
- [Addressed some edits](https://yaaminiv.github.io/WGBS-Analysis-Part33/)

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

- Sent manuscript to dissertation reading committee! And then did literally nothing else with this manuscript

**Virginica Adult Methylation** and **Virginica Adult RNA-Seq**::

- Steven and Sam took the lead on this project while I was on vacation/working on finalizing my dissertation! I'll pick this up once my dissertation is submitted

**Other**:

- Finalized ocean acidification and reproduction review!

### August Goals Recap

- Extra things if I have time prior to submitting my final dissertation, but are really more important for a manuscript
  - Extract SNPs with `EpiDiverse` and create a relatedness matrix
  - Look at methylation islands and non-methylated regions
  - Examine overlaps between DML and other epigenomic datasets
  - Email Rajan with more complete manuscript and ask for input
