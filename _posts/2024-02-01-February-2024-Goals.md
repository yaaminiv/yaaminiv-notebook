### [January Goals recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/January-2024-Goals/)

**West Coast Green Crab Experiment**:

- I'm still at decontamination station...but there's been some progress in understanding WHY I'm there.
- [Trained Vanessa in PCR and gel analyses](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2023-Part33/)

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

- Addressed Ann's comments on the methods and results

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- Updated methods and results from metabolomics and lipidomics analyses
- Started reviewing green crab thermal physiology literature

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

- Sigh. Another month not actually getting to any of this.

**Other**:

- Submitted three additional faculty applications
- Worked on PRISMA searches for WOCinEEB Global Change collaboration
- Monitored RIE2 email and updated database

### February Goals

**West Coast Green Crab Experiment**:

- Figure out contamination issues
- Complete extractions and PCR for TTR crabs
- Conduct preliminary individual-level analyses

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- Continue reading green crab thermal physiology literature
- Revise metabolomics analysis
- Revise lipidomics analysis
- Update methods and results

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

- Modify analytical methods based on feedback
- Update methods and results
- Update supplementary material
- Write discussion
- Write abstract

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

- Finish `methylKit` contingency tests
- Conduct a randomization test for DML identification
- Integrate other epigenetic datasets
- Update methods and results
- Revise discussion

**Other**:

- Seminar at URI
- Submit additional faculty applications
- Review NSF proposal
- Launch RIE2 survey
- PRISMA searches for WOCinEEB Global Change collaboration
- Extract metadata for the WOCinEEB Global Change collaboration

### Deep Freeze

Things that are not immediate enough to be on the backburner, so they're stuck in the deep freeze.

**Virginica Methylation and Expression**:

I'll return to this when I have an updated discussion for the Hawaii paper.

- Update methods and results from quadratic addition to transcriptional noise model
- Compare transcriptional noise analysis with Liew and Aranda papers

**Killifish Methylation and Expression**:

I'll return to this when I have a good draft of the coral paper.

- Pathway analysis for RNA-Seq data
- Determine protocol for SNP identification
- Conduct in silico RRBS digestion
- Characterize DEG that overlap between populations
- Quantify gene expression variability
- Visualize DEG data

**Zebrafish DNMT**:

I'll think about this once I have a robust killifish paper draft.

- Identify a stress condition to use for the zebrafish based on disease factors or conditions that are known to induce changes in methylation
- Determine physiological endpoints to assess for embryos
- Construct a project timeline
