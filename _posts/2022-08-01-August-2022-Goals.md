### [July Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/July-2022-Goals/)

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- [Finalized respirometry and time-to-right protocols](https://github.com/yaaminiv/green-crab-metabolomics)
- [Completed an experiment!](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-Part12/)

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

- Wasn't able to finish the TagSeq analysis but I started to gather the components I needed for the bioinformatic analysis

**Killifish Methylation and Expression**:

- Wasn't able to make much progress on this project because of the experiment

**Virginica Methylation and Expression**:

- [Finalized methylation data and results](https://yaaminiv.github.io/CEABiGR-Part5/)

### August Goals

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

- Complete initial TagSeq analysis and discuss with Maggie
- Update methods and results

**Killifish Methylation and Expression**:

- Test `BAT_DMRcorrelating` to match RRBS and RNA-Seq data
- Investigate SNP associations with RRBS data
- Look into mQTL analysis
- Start RRBS mapping with new genome
- Update methods and results

**Virginica Methylation and Expression**:

- Examine connections between transcript counts and methylation
- Determine which hypothesis-driven analyses from the workshop should be incorporated into the paper or redone based on gene expression results
- Finish transcriptional noise analysis
- Return to SPLS

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- Analyze survivorship data by treatment and sex
- Analyze time-to-right data by treatment, sex, weight, and integument color
- Determine workflow for respiration data analysis
- Determine workflow for metabolomics sample processing

**Other**:

- Address reviewer comments on ocean acidification and reproduction review
- Check in about eelgrass transcriptomics paper
- Evaluate projects in deep freeze
- Distribute results of postdoctoral mentorship experiences survey
- Launch the postdoctoral mentoring program
- Apply for any relevant faculty positions or funding opportunities

### Deep Freeze

Things that are not immediate enough to be on the backburner, so they're stuck in the deep freeze.

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

Once the eelgrass paper is submitted and the Manchester paper is about to be published, I can start thinking about this paper again.

- Address Rajan's edits
- Return to `methylKit` for better interpretation
- Extract SNPs with `EpiDiverse` and create a relatedness matrix
- Look at methylation islands and non-methylated regions
- Examine overlaps between DML and other epigenomic datasets from Sascha

**Zebrafish DNMT**:

I'll think about this once I finish my pilot experiment.

- Identify a stress condition to use for the zebrafish based on disease factors or conditions that are known to induce changes in methylation
- Determine physiological endpoints to assess for embryos
- Construct a project timeline
