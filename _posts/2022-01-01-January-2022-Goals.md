Break? Over. Rest? Acquired. Projects? Ready to be tackled.

Me? Not ready to work yet but oh well here we go.

I have some lofty goals this month, but my plan is to try and split my time more effectively between my PhD and postdoc projects. I think I'll work a couple days at home and dedicate those to PhD projects, and spend my office days working on postdoc projects. Hopefully the physical separation will help me compartmentalize the work so I don't feel guilty for not working on postdoc projects while working on my PhD projects, and vice versa!

### [November Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/November-2021-Goals/)

**Gigas Gonad Methylation**:

- SO CLOSE to finishing reworking the discussion! But also not done. Whoops.

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

- I didn't have time to work on the Hawaii paper, but now that I have Rajan's feedback I can start to incorporate that as I restart my work

**Virginica Gonad Methylation**:

- Talked through methods with Steven and Sam
- Have yet to extract SNPs or perform any actual analysis myself

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

- [Decided on an extraction protocol and tested the extractions](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Coral-Hypoxia-RNA-Extractions/)
- [Tested the extractions again using different starting volumes](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Coral-Hypoxia-RNA-Extractions-Part2/). It did not go well, but I have a plan to move forward!
- I put a hold on metatranscriptomics methods until I could figure out how to successfully extract coral RNA. You know, baby steps.

**NSF PRFB**:

- Successfully wrote and submitted my NSF PRFB!

**Other**:

- Finished identifying new papers for ocean acidification and reproduction review
- Completed Molecular Ecology review
- Identified a killifish RRBS and RNA-Seq dataset to work on with Neel
- Discussed potential projects involving DNMT-3 knockout zebrafish or menhaden with Neel

### January Goals

**Gigas Gonad Methylation**:

- FINALLY finish the discussion
- Revise the introduction and abstract
- Send to Steven for edits
- Submit to a journal and bioRXiv

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

- Address Rajan's edits
- Review `DSS` script and determine if I should go back to `methylKit` for better interpretation
- Extract SNPs with `EpiDiverse` and create a relatedness matrix
- Look at methylation islands and non-methylated regions
- Examine overlaps between DML and other epigenomic datasets from Sascha

**Virginica Gonad Methylation**:

- Update methods of draft paper
- Extract SNPs with BSnper and `EpiDiverse`
- Identify methods for linking WGBS and RNA-Seq data
- Identify lncRNA and miRNAs in dataset

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

- Continue testing extraction protocol to identify a successful methods
- Use gel to check RNA integrity
- Extract all *A. cervicornis* samples

**Killifish Methylation and Expression**:

- Review BAT mapping and DMR identification protocol
- Start mapping procedure for methylation data
- Identify protocol for RNA-Seq data

**Ocean Acidification and Reproduction Review**:

- Start integrating new papers into main text and supplemental material
- Revise figures

**Other**:

- Meet with Carolyn, Ann, and Neel to discuss projects and funding opportunities for the next six months
- Develop any potential projects
- Coordinate postdoctoral mentoring program with Maggi
