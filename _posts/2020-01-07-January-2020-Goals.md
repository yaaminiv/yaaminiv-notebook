I'm back from vacation and (theoretically) recharged and ready to start working again! I have grand plans for this month.

### **[December Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/December-2019-Goals/)**:

**Virginica Gonad Methylation**:

- SUBMITTED THAT PAPER (while on vacation RIP)!
- Rejoiced.
- Prepared metadata for BCO-DMO submission
- [Cleaned up repository](https://github.com/epigeneticstoocean/paper-gonad-meth) and added relevant supplementary material. It still needs a bit of work but it was good enough for submission.

**Gigas Gonad Methylation**:

- Did not figure out if more samples should be sequenced or attempt GO-MWU enrichment and DMG analysis...because paper and vacation.

**Other**:

- Presented at Huxley Environmental Speaker Series! The students were really interested in the nitty-gritty of methylation analysis which was unexpected but nice. It was a good experience for me to figure out what information to include in talks to bulk it up, and what information isn't as necessary for the story.
- Wrote questions for the Marine Bio final. I got my evaluations back too and they were positive!
- Did not finalize sample preparation flowchart for methylation analysis or figure out next steps for *C. virginica* sperm analysis...because paper and vacation.

### January Goals

**Gigas Gonad Methylation**:

- Attempt GO-MWU enrichment and DMG analysis to have better data
- Figure out what additional samples need to be sequenced and how
- Start putting together preliminary poster for ASLO

**Virginica Sperm Methylation**:

- Meet with Katie and Alan to figure out what additional samples I have access to and what methods I should use

** All Mechanism Study**:

- Figure out what samples I have access to and come up with an extraction and sequencing plan 

**Other**:

- Finalize *C. virginica* repository and post submitted paper on bioRXiv
- Get committee reading lists and start studying for quals
