TFW you defend but pretend you don't have any other work to do and temporarily live in bliss :)

Well, I defended! I put off thinking about the rest of my work temporarily, but it's time to get some things done so I can shut my brain off (again).

### [June Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/June-2021-Goals/)

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

- [Successfully used `topGO` to identify enriched GOterms associated with genic DML](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Hawaii-Gigas-Methylation-Analysis-Part21/)
- [Created figures and ran statistical analyses](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Hawaii-Gigas-Methylation-Analysis-Part20/)
- Wrote a complete initial manuscript, and sent it to my committee before the defense!
- Didn't extract SNPs with `EpiDiverse` or look at methylation islands and non-methylated regions since it wasn't critical for the defense

**Gigas Gonad Methylation**:

- [Finalize figures and statistical analyses, and identified enriched GOterms](https://yaaminiv.github.io/WGBS-Analysis-Part30/)
- [Reran `methylKit` using a 4 vs. 4 design and revised downstream analyses](https://yaaminiv.github.io/WGBS-Analysis-Part31/)
- Wrote a complete initial manuscript, and sent it to my committee before the defense!

**Other**:

- Finished (almost) all work on the ocean acidification and reproduction review
- Presented at the Chew Series seminar
- **DEFENDED!** Then spent my days laying on the floor and watching TV

### July Goals

**Gigas Gonad Methylation**:

- Update manuscript with revised figures and enrichment results
- Send manuscript to dissertation reading committee
- Address any edits in real-time

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

- Send manuscript to dissertation reading committee
- Address any edits in real-time
- Review `DSS` script and determine if I should go back to `methylKit` for better interpretation
- Extract SNps with `EpiDiverse` and create a relatedness matrix
- Look at methylation islands and non-methylated regions
- Examine overlaps between DML and other epigenomic datasets
- Update manuscript

**Virginica Adult Methylation**:

- Create and run an nf-core script to analyze methylation data
- Identify differentially methylated loci related to sex, pH treatment, and sex:pH

**Virginica Adult RNA-Seq**:

- Determine a workflow to analyze RNA-Seq data that is splice-aware
- Start preliminary data analysis

**Other**:

- Submit ocean acidification and reproduction review
