## Things to do if I had infinite research money

Now that I'm wrapping up my DNR and Manchester papers, I need to think of what to do next! I did some literature scans and have some ideas on what I could do if I had research funding. Some ideas are more fleshed out than others, and some are probably better off as side projects, but that's okay.

- Translating model organism work to a non-model organism: Manila clams
  - Manila clams have a genome and are an important tribal resource. It would be cool to do some of the first transgenerational ocean acidification, gene expression, and epigenetic regulation work on a species that people depend on for food
- Invasive species and epigenetics
  - I don't know why but I've really started to get interested in invasive species. I think considering both climate change stressors and invasive species effects on ecosystems would be cool to do at a genetic or epigenetic level
  - Epigenetic comparison of original Japanese Pacific oyster population, and the Washington population. There's been some evidence to suggest that different populations of *C. gigas* respond differently to ocean acidification. I could compare the genetic and epigenetic potential of different *C. gigas* populations to adapt to climate change, and then relate different adaptation potentials to the projections for the environment they live in.
  - Tracking green crab invasions with epigenetics.
- Response timing: when a stressor occurs, and when the effect can be detected
  - Test a gradient of different exposure times and lag times on both wild and hatchery populations
  - Sample wild oysters after an upwelling event (or other acute stressors) and see if we can detect a response
  - Compare adult and larval methylomes from my 2017 hatchery experiment to see if there's any evidence of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance
  - Species comparison of genetic and epigenetic responses to multiple stressors. Can compare Pacific and Olympia oysters in both hatchery and wild settings
