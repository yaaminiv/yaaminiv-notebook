### [April Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/April-2019-Goals/):

i.e. me marveling at the ambition I had

**Virginica Gonad Methylation**:

- Modified [paper repo](https://github.com/epigeneticstoocean/paper-gonad-meth/tree/master/code) so analysis is easily reproducible
- Refined my DML analysis and (almost) finished refning the general methylation analysis
- Didnt' get to DMR or gene-level analysis because I am still sorting out issues with the general methylation trend analysis

**Virginica Sperm**:

- I was focusing on the gonad methylation paper so I haven't thought about lab work

**Other**:

- Gave a [talk at the SAFS Centennial Celebration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TbcVPMdo1w&list=PLgDT5hypdTyTHB5lI338UDbinahTxU8ew&index=55&t=0s) and public lecture at Town Hall Seattle!
- Between the current paper and giving two talks, my milestone progress took a back seat

### May Goals

i.e. me trying to set some realistic expectations for this month while also trying to achieve everything I didn't do last week and making progress beyond that

**Virginica Gonad Methylation**:

- Troubleshoot CpG counts and finalize general methylation trends by May 3
- Preliminary description of genes with differentially methylated loci by May 5
- Differentially methylated region analysis by May 7
- Differentially methylated gene analysis by May 9
- Discussion outline by May 9
- Draft paper by May 12
- Paper submission to bioRXiv by May 31

**Gigas Gonad and Larvae Methylation**:

- Have MBD workflow meeting
- Extract RNA
- Process DNA for bisulfite sequencing
- Send DNA and RNA for sequencing
- Develop plan for processing larval samples

**Virginica Sperm Methylation**:

- Identify samples for RNA-Seq
- Extract RNA
- Process DNA for bisulfite sequencing
- Send DNA and RNA for sequencing

**Other**:

- Identify a GSR
- Schedule a committee meeting for summer
