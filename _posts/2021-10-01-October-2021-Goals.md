After a month-long vacation, I'm in Woods Hole and I'm now a Postdoctoral Scholar :open_mouth: So as much as I'd like to be like Gibbs and leap over my responsibilities like a flying loaf of bread, it's time to get back to it and make the most of the next 18 months.

### [August Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/August-2021-Goals/)

**Gigas Gonad Methylation**:

- Addressed reading committee edits!

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

- Addressed reading committee edits! I was pretty low on time (and energy) so I didn't do more than the minimum requirements

**Dissertation**:

- Format published chapters using Huskydown in [this Github repository](https://github.com/yaaminiv/dissertation). There were several things that were a bit annoying to figure out since I needed to use Latex for certain things like tables, but now I have a pretty nice template for individual papers.
- Submitted my dissertation and it was approved!

**Other**:

- Cleaned out office and reorganized -80ÂºC freezer
- Put a plan together for finishing remaining projects

### October Goals

**Gigas Gonad Methylation**:

- Revisit genes with DML and association with enrichment
- Update methods and results
- Rework discussion to include more direct comparisons to other oyster methylation papers

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

- Clean up any remaining comments
- Send manuscript to Maria to get methods information
- Email Rajan and ask for input
- Review `DSS` script and determine if I should go back to `methylKit` for better interpretation
- Extract SNPs with `EpiDiverse` and create a relatedness matrix
- Look at methylation islands and non-methylated regions
- Examine overlaps between DML and other epigenomic datasets from Sascha

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

- Review Maggie's extraction protocol and previous work
- Determine if metatranscriptomics, metabolomics, and/or methylation analysis are viable options

**Other**:

- Complete onboarding
- Think about goals and potential projects for postdoc
- Outline a project for NSF PRFB and contact letter writers
- Identify additional papers for ocean acidification and reproduction review
- Complete review for Scientific Data
