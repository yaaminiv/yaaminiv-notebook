## My samples are on the Mass Spec!

So exciting! To monitor the mass spec progress remotely, we're using TeamViewer. While my samples are running, it is my responsibility to:

1. **Queue samples.** I added all of my samples for both replicates in a random sequence to the program. This can be saved and exported as a sequence file. I also need to add a few samples at a time to the active queue.
2. **Check pressure.** If the pressure is too low, I need to delete all items in the active queue, with the exception of the current sample that's running, immediately and call Emma.
3. **Make sure everything is good.** Easier said than done, right?

Once my samples are done, I'll start analysis using Pecan and Skyline. For now, catch me compulsively checking TeamViewer at 3 a.m.
