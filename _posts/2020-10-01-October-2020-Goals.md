### **[September Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/September-2020-Goals/)**

**Virginica Labwork**:

- Based on the coral paper, we decided to do WGBS for the adult samples, not MBD. So I paused that work until I could get samples from Katie and Alan to repeat extractions
- Outlined the *C. virginica* heredity paper

**Other**:

- Updated figures and text for the ocean acidification and reproduction review, so that's almost done
- Started on postdoc positon applications
- Helped students with NSF GRFP applications

Honestly nothing really happened this month...burn out was real.

####**October Goals**:

**Virginica Labwork**:

- Determine a protocol for DNA extraction (and potential simultaneous RNA extraction)
- Send DNA (and potential RNA) samples for sequencing

**Gigas Gonad Labwork**:

- Order materials for RNA isolation, if needed
- Test RNA extraction protocol
- Extract RNA from histology samples sent for WGBS
- Send RNA for sequencing

**ATAC-Seq Labwork**:

- Identify supplies needed and order
- Determine which samples should be used for testing

**Coral Methylation Comparison**:

- Address suggestions and comments

**Other**:

- Finalize ocean acidification and reproduction review for friendly reviewers
- Create WGCNA and GO-MWU figures fro *Z. marina* analyses
- Continue helping with NSF GRFP workshop
