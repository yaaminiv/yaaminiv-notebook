February was a short month (even with the extra day where nothing was impossible #30Rock) but I managed to do a lot! Am I finally getting the hang of things? Maybe...but I am going on vacation at the end of this month so things are bound to fall apart.

### [February Goals recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/February-2024-Goals/)

**West Coast Green Crab Experiment**:

- FIGURED OUT MY CONTAMINATION ISSUES! Turns out it was an issue with [primer stock](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2023-Part36/) AND [samples](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2023-Part37/)
- Chugging along on my extractions. Vanessa and I have finished most of the sampled TTR crabs.
- [Conducted preliminary individual-level analyses](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2023-Part34/)

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- Started reading green crab thermal physiology literature
- Presented revised metabolomics analysis and future ideas in lab meeting
- [Updated the GLM methods for respirometry analysis](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-Part27/)

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

- Modified analytical methods based on feedback
- Updated methods and results
- Updated supplementary material
- Wrote my portion of the abstract

**Virginica Methylation and Expression**:

We're gearing for a March submission of the CEABiGR paper, so I moved this out of the deep freeze.

- Updated methods and results from quadratic addition to transcriptional noise model
- [Modeled the shift in the predominant isoform](https://yaaminiv.github.io/CEABiGR-Part11/)
- [Summarized gene activity information](https://yaaminiv.github.io/CEABiGR-Part12/)
- [Visualized predominant isoform analysis results](https://yaaminiv.github.io/CEABiGR-Part12/)
- [Conducted an enrichment test for the genes where the predominant isoform shifted](https://yaaminiv.github.io/CEABiGR-Part12/)

**Other**:

- Gave a seminar at URI fully about my crab data!
- Continued PRISMA searches for WOCinEEB Global Change collaboration

### March Goals

**Virginica Methylation and Expression**:

- Address all analyses in [this issue]
- Create all figures in [this issue]
- Compare transcriptional noise analysis with Liew and Aranda papers in discussion
- Write discussion
- Write introduction
- Write abstract
- Send manuscript to co-authors
- Incorporate co-author feedback
- Submit manuscript

**West Coast Green Crab Experiment**:

- Finish extractions, PCR, and gel for all remaining crab samples
- Send samples for sequencing

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- Continue reading green crab thermal physiology literature

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

This will depend on when Maggie gets back from the field. Since I can't do a lot independently at the moment, these may or may not get done this month.

- Finalize abstract
- Outline discussion

**Other**:

- Sort duplicates for WOCinEEB Global Change collaboration
- Send papers to the appropriate groups
- Supervise Sophia's data extraction
- Take care of RIE2 tasks

### Deep Freeze

Things that are not immediate enough to be on the backburner, so they're stuck in the deep freeze.

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

I'll return to this next month, after we submit the CEABiGR paper this month.

- Finish `methylKit` contingency tests
- Conduct a randomization test for DML identification
- Integrate other epigenetic datasets
- Update methods and results
- Revise discussion

**Killifish Methylation and Expression**:

I'll return to this when I have a good draft of the coral paper.

- Pathway analysis for RNA-Seq data
- Determine protocol for SNP identification
- Conduct in silico RRBS digestion
- Characterize DEG that overlap between populations
- Quantify gene expression variability
- Visualize DEG data

**Zebrafish DNMT**:

I'll think about this once I have a robust killifish paper draft.

- Identify a stress condition to use for the zebrafish based on disease factors or conditions that are known to induce changes in methylation
- Determine physiological endpoints to assess for embryos
- Construct a project timeline
