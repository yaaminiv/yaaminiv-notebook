In preparation for my first committee meeting, I'm tackling the long-outstanding task of reorganizing the [project-oyster-oa repository](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-oyster-oa). While I shuffle things around and add README.md files, links in this lab notebook will definitely break! All links will be repaired by the beginning of October.
