## Treatment Days 33-39

This week is an off-week for my experiment, but Julia is running her heat pulse experiment!

**7/31/23**:

-HOBO data for all tanks
  - Low battery: t9a, t1a, t1b
  - t9b died 7/29. Saved data and replaced with another HOBO logger
  - Some HOBO loggers have funky names, so here's that list
    -test_1 t6a
    -06012023-1: t3a
    -test_9a: t5a
    -test8: t4a
- Saved HOBO data for Lauren's tanks and relaunched to use in Julia's tanks
- The water flow on the right side of the 15ºC water bath was...weird. The flow was pretty minimal and at one point it just stopped. I tried using a different part of the 14ºC line but I got the same issue. Interestingly, the 14ºC line on the left of the water bath was flowing fine. I called Rick and he sent Pete from Facilities to look at it. Pete thought there was a flow issue because of temperature (the lines apparently turn off when the temperature is outisde of a certain threshold) or maybe some seaweed. In any case, it's fixed now.
- No mortalities!
  - T1: 9
  - T2: 9
  - T3: 9
  - T4: 10
  - T5: 8
  - T6: 6
  - T7: 8
  - T8: 8
  - T9: 6
- Set up Julia's experiment
  - Moved crabs from 10ºC and certain 15ºC crabs to their experimental tanks
  - Took metadata and did TTR
  - Set up 30ºC heat pulses with immersion heaters in 2 tanks

**8/1/23**:

- No mortalities!
  - T1: 9
  - T2: 9
  - T3: 9
  - T4: 10
  - T5: 8
  - T6: 6
  - T7: 8
  - T8: 8
  - T9: 6
- Julia's experiment
  - One whole tank of heat pulse crabs died. We have no idea why, but our working theory is that maybe there was a microbial growth that became hazardous at 30ºC. We cleaned the tanks and proceeded with TTR and respirometry for all live crabs.
  - We took some crabs from the tanks that didn't experience pulse 1 and started a second heat pulse with those four crabs at 1 p.m. so we could get heat pulse measurements from them tomorrow morning.
  - Salinities for respirometry
    - T10: 33
    - T12: 33
    - T13: 30
  - When moving some tanks around for Julia's experiment, some water got on the electrical set up and the power strip with the lights went out. I reset the GFCS and Julia dried the cords. Everything worked again except for a temperature control box, so we replaced it.
  - In this process, I noticed some filters and air stones were plugged into a power strip that was plugged into the light power strip...meaning it was on a timer. Unclear how long that has been the case.

**8/2/23**:

- No mortalities!
  - T1: 9
  - T2: 9
  - T3: 9
  - T4: 10
  - T5: 8
  - T6: 6
  - T7: 8
  - T8: 8
  - T9: 6
- Filled the 5ºC water baths with more freshwater
- T11 heater was not on at 7:30 a.m...what?! I plugged it in and we decided to take TTR measurements at 11 a.m. The crabs experienced a less intense pulse, but still a pulse.
- HOBO data for all tanks
  - ACCIDENTALLY WROTE OVER T9B FILE FROM HISTORICAL EXP DATA….should have had my GitHub already set up
  - Low batteries: t9a, t7b, t1a, t4b
  - T11's HOBO data was WEIRD. The logger on the bottom said the temperature dropped down to 25ºC overnight, but the top logger said the temperature was at 45ºC? Turns out the T11 airstone was one of those daisy chained into a timer outlet Monday night. It's possible that at 6 p.m. when the air stone stopped circulating water in the tank, the heater probe at the bottom of the tank was not registering the temperature at the top of the tank where the heater was heating. So...we boiled a lot of crabs.

**8/3/23**:

- Replaced 60% of water in all tanks and added ammonia conditioner. It was supposed to be an ammonia day, but we ran out of test kit materials (specifically solution 2). I bought some more to use for the remainder of the experiment.

### Going forward

1. Continue doing daily checks and with experimental time points
2. Assist Lauren and Julia with final presentations
2. Test formatting and analysis for one set of respirometry data
7. Respirometry analysis
8. Update methods
9. Update results
