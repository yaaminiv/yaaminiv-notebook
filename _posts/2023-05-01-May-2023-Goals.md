I truly feel like the past month has been the epitome of me running around like a headless chicken. This month is going to be a lot of them same since I'm going on vacation for a bit over two weeks!

### [April Goals recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/April-2023-Goals/)

**Green Crab Summer Experiment**:

- Created an experimental plan and timeline
- Met with the two SSF and PEP students to plan summer projects! They both seem awesome and I'm excited to work with them on independent projects
- Coordinated logistics for summer experiments with MFW, WDFW, and folks at ESL
- Budgeted for experimental materials using PDS and NSF PRFB funds

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- Updated experimental methods
- I didn't finish demographic data analysis or get started on the respirometry analysis, but I did finish the [survivorship](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-Part15/) and [time-to-right](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-Part16/) analyses!
- I budgeted for metabolomics materials and contacted the sequencing facility, but they are booked out and said they would contact me in 3 months. Based on their availability, I may look into other metabolomics cores and determine the cost-effectiveness of sending samples to be prepped externally versus in-house

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

- Since Ann, Maggie, and I all had various travel obligations, I took a break from this project in April, knowing that we'd reconvene later.

**Virginica Methylation and Expression**:

- Updated results with initial `mixOmics` analysis
- Discussed the modeling efforts further to [include a quadratic relationship between gene expression and transcriptional noise](https://yaaminiv.github.io/CEABiGR-Part10/)

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

- Didn't do anything for this project :/

**Other**:

- Also didn't look into the mindful productivity course. Whoops.

### May Goals

**Green Crab Summer Experiment**:

- Determine a reasonable biochemistry project for Lauren
- Order experimental materials

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- Analyze respirometry data
- Update methods and results

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

- Add Rajan's edits as comments to the draft manuscript
- Review `EpiDiverse` output and create a new SNP list
- Rerun `methylKit`
- Conduct a randomization test for DML identification
- Update methods and results

**Virginica Methylation and Expression**:

- Update methods and results from quadratic addition to transcriptional noise model
- Compare transcriptional noise analysis with Liew and Aranda papers

**Other**:

- MINDFUL PRODUCTIVITY MODULE I

### Deep Freeze

Things that are not immediate enough to be on the backburner, so they're stuck in the deep freeze.

**Killifish Methylation and Expression**:

I'll return to this when I have a good draft of the coral paper.

- Pathway analysis for RNA-Seq data
- Determine protocol for SNP identification
- Conduct in silico RRBS digestion
- Characterize DEG that overlap between populations
- Quantify gene expression variability
- Visualize DEG data

**Zebrafish DNMT**:

I'll think about this once I have a robust killifish paper draft.

- Identify a stress condition to use for the zebrafish based on disease factors or conditions that are known to induce changes in methylation
- Determine physiological endpoints to assess for embryos
- Construct a project timeline
