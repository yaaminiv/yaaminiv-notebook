title: BCA Assay Trial 2
---

## If at first you don't succeed, trial trial again.

Happy #microplatemonday! With a working microplate reader available to us, we proceeded (again) with the BCA Assay. We followed the [protocol](https://yaaminiv.github.io/BCA-Assay-Trial-1/) generated during our last attempt. The only difference between what is listed in that entry and what happened during our attempt is that I broke the bottom of microplate well E9. Sample O07 only had two replicates (E7 and E8).

Here are some photos from our lab work:

Once in the Genome Sciences Building, we did the following:

#### **Plate incubation**

#### **Microplate reader**
