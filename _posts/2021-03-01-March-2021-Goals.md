With [Pubathon 2021](https://robertslab.github.io/resources/Pubathon/) in full swing, I've been doing more writing (or at least, staring into the distance thinking about writing, then thinking about the analyses and work that comes before the writing, then panicking...)! My goals this month center around completing initial drafts of the Hawaii and Manchester, and setting myself up for new projects next quarter.

### [February Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/February-2021-Goals/)

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

- [Evaluated `bismark` output using coral methylation workflow!](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Hawaii-Gigas-Methylation-Analysis-Part5/)
- I wasn't able to look at the methylation with [`methylKit`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/methylKit/inst/doc/methylKit.html), but I've investigated a few packages (`DSS` and `ramwas`) to test out later
- Locate an ATAC-Seq dataset that could be used to practice integrating chromatin information with methylation
- [Started drafting the manuscript!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uqPDX2BWuWlEeS_d5JMTATvJFaEJOZED2SOVpqkLOJM/edit#heading=h.cmsdeulk6pg5)
- Investigated ways to identify SNPs from WGBS data

**Gigas Gonad Methylation**:

- [Trimmed samples](https://yaaminiv.github.io/WGBS-Analysis-Part11/) and [evaulated with `multiqc`](https://yaaminiv.github.io/WGBS-Analysis-Part12/)
- [Aligned samples with `bismark` (but have yet to evaluate the output)](https://yaaminiv.github.io/WGBS-Analysis-Part13/)
- I didn't make it much farther than `bismark`!
- [Made a Google Doc for the manuscript...but there are no words whoops](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tEqyvmxe4CqBbq-bBeOa_r0oX_WH1SPy9ofJg26p3po/edit)

**Virginica Labwork**:

- [Sent DNA and RNA for WGBS and RNA-Seq](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Virginica-Gonad-DNA-Extractions-Part14/)! I should receive samples at the end of March/beginning of April

**ATAC-Seq Labwork**:

- lol this is where the panicking happened

**Other**:

- Continued working on ocean acidification and reproduction review whenever I had time
- Completed my review for Evolutionary Applications (not Molecular Ecology I misspoke)
- Watched SICB talks and participated in a live discussion!

### March Goals

Some very similar goals to last month, with a few additions.

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

- Align samples to the [Roslin genome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_902806645.1) and compare to previous alignments
- Extract SNPs from bisulfite sequencing data with `BS-SNPer` and `EpiDiverse`
- Compare `BS-SNPer` and `EpiDiverse` output and determine which approach is suitable
- Complete preliminary assessment of DML with `methylKit`
- Try identifying DML with `DSS` and `ramwas`
- Compare `ramwas` and `DSS` DML output and determine which approach is suitable
- Determine genomic location of DML
- Identify significantly enriched GOterms associated with DML
- Identify methylation islands and non-methylated regions
- Locate an ATAC-Seq dataset that could be used to practice integrating chromatin information with methylation
- Have a complete initial manuscript

**Gigas Gonad Methylation**:

- Align samples to the [Roslin genome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_902806645.1) and compare to previous alignments
- Extract SNPs from bisulfite sequencing data with the method determined from Hawaii samples
- Identify DML using  [`methylKit`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/methylKit/inst/doc/methylKit.html)
- Determine genomic location of DML
- Identify significantly enriched GOterms associated with DML
- Identify methylation islands and non-methylated regions
- Decide if it's worth extracting gonad RNA for integrated RNA-Seq and methylation analyses
- Have a complete initial manuscript

**ATAC-Seq Labwork**:

- Purchase reagents and identify samples to test cell dissociation protocols
- Ensure protocol is easy to follow and is accessible for the lab
- Dissociate and cryopreserve some cells

**Other**:

- Submit ocean acidification and reproduction review
- Complete a peer review for Molecular Ecology
- Go on vacation :)
