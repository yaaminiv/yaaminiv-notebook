By starting new things, maybe that means actually setting reasonable goals. Jury's out on whether or not it'll work.

### [July Goals recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/July-2023-Goals/)

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- I finished the respirometry analysis! Kinda. It's 80% done without removing the background because Julia wanted to use my script to analyze her data

**West Coast Green Crab Experiment**:

- Can confirm I am physically alive but maybe not all there mentally

**Summer Students**:

- Assisted with Lauren's abstract for SACNAS
- Didn't need to write Julia a letter after all, but I wrote one for Lauren's SACNAS application!
- Assisted students with their independent projects and analysis
- Facilitated introductions between students and other WHOI scientists

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

- Started reworking metaanalysis

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

- Added Rajan's edits as comments to the draft manuscript

### August Goals

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- Remove background respiration from oxygen consumption calculations
- Update methods and results

**West Coast Green Crab Experiment**:

- Shut down the 15ºC and 25ºC tanks during week 6
- Shut down the 5ºC tanks during week 7
- Investigate any discrepancies in crab labelling and update relevant spreadsheets

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

- Get other epigenetic datasets
- Finish `methylKit` contingency tests
- Conduct a randomization test for DML identification
- Integrate with other epigenetic datasets
- Update methods and results

**Other**:

- Review paper for Evolutionary Applications
- Review paper for Aquaculture
- Start draft of Evolution Symposium
- Revise CV
- Revise research statement
- Revise teaching statement

### Deep Freeze

Things that are not immediate enough to be on the backburner, so they're stuck in the deep freeze.

**Virginica Methylation and Expression**:

I'll return to this when I have an updated discussion for the Hawaii paper.

- Update methods and results from quadratic addition to transcriptional noise model
- Compare transcriptional noise analysis with Liew and Aranda papers

**Killifish Methylation and Expression**:

I'll return to this when I have a good draft of the coral paper.

- Pathway analysis for RNA-Seq data
- Determine protocol for SNP identification
- Conduct in silico RRBS digestion
- Characterize DEG that overlap between populations
- Quantify gene expression variability
- Visualize DEG data

**Zebrafish DNMT**:

I'll think about this once I have a robust killifish paper draft.

- Identify a stress condition to use for the zebrafish based on disease factors or conditions that are known to induce changes in methylation
- Determine physiological endpoints to assess for embryos
- Construct a project timeline
