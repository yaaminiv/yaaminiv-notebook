Spent a lot of time in April coding! Which means I was the bottom-right Nick Cage on more than one occasion.

### [April Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/April-2022-Goals/)

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

- We decided to evaluate some existing datasets and think about extractions for a different experiment later

**Killifish Methylation and Expression**

- Finished [mapping all samples](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Killifish-Hypoxia-RRBS-Part6/), [extracting](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Killifish-Hypoxia-RRBS-Part7/) and [filtering methylation](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Killifish-Hypoxia-RRBS-Part8/)!
- Started [testing the analysis module](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Killifish-Hypoxia-RRBS-Part9/) but ran into a few issues

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- Spoke to Carolyn and we decided to get a pilot experiment going for this summer!
- Drafted an experiment plan
- Got in contact with Rick to determine which facilities to use for this experiment
- Found tanks, heaters, and chillers that could be used
- Spoke with Zac and Chris about respiration methods

**Virginica Methylation and Expression**:

- Ran into a [computational issue for SPLS tuning](https://yaaminiv.github.io/CEABiGR-Part2/), so I paused
- Updated foundational methods and results

**Other**:

- Sent out postdoctoral mentorship survey! I also contacted the chairs of departmental mentorship committees to get them to circulate it.
- Got the go-ahead for the pre-application postdoctoral mentoring program!
- Kept my eye out for any relevant faculty positions or funding opportunities

### May Goals

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

- Evaluate the existing dataset and discuss plans with Maggie

**Killifish Methylation and Expression**

- Characterize the general methylation landscape
- Identify and annotate DMR
- Update methods and results for methylation dataset
- Start RNA-Seq analysis

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- Identify a facility I can use for experiments
- Determine the coldest temperature that I can achieve
- Practice respirometry methods with crabs
- Plan for the start date!

**Virginica Methylation and Expression**:

- Finish updating foundational methylation dataset methods and results
- Return to SPLS
- Determine which hypothesis-driven analyses from the workshop should be incorporated into the paper or redone

**Other**:

- SUBMIT THE REPRODUCTION REVIEW
- Continue working on the eelgrass paper
- Disseminate the results of the mentorship experiences survey
- Launch the postdoctoral mentoring program
- Apply for any relevant faculty positions or funding opportunities

### Deep Freeze

Things that are not immediate enough to be on the backburner, so they're stuck in the deep freeze.

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

Once the reproduction review and eelgrass paper are submitted, I can start thinking about this paper again.

- Address Rajan's edits
- Review `DSS` script and determine if I should go back to `methylKit` for better interpretation
- Extract SNPs with `EpiDiverse` and create a relatedness matrix
- Look at methylation islands and non-methylated regions
- Examine overlaps between DML and other epigenomic datasets from Sascha

**Zebrafish DNMT**:

I'll think about this once I finish my pilot experiment.

- Identify a stress condition to use for the zebrafish based on disease factors or conditions that are known to induce changes in methylation
- Determine physiological endpoints to assess for embryos
- Construct a project timeline
