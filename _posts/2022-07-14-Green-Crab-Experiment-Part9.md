## Treatment Days 8 through 10

### Day 8

- Protocol for today
  - Performed TTR for seven randomly selected crabs in a tank. Sexed, gauged color, measured, and weighed each sampled crab, then labelled each crab with a number. Based on weight (20-30 g), we selected crabs for respirometry.
  - Acclimated three selected crabs for one hour
  - Measured oxygen consumption. The goal was to measure consumption until the chambers reached 75-80% oxygen.
  - Removed crabs from the respirometry chambers. Resealed the chamber and measured background respiration for 20 minutes. Empty chambers and wipe down with 70% ethanol.
  - Use refractometer to get salinity measurement for acclimation tank
  -  Notes
    - Usually set up acclimation for one tank while performing TTR for the next tank
    - T3: Recalibrated probe 2
    - T4: 2 dead crabs. 1 male, blue-green, 1 female, orange, open abdomen
    - Warm temperatures seem to be speeding up molt cycle
- Tank order
  - T6
  - T3
  - T2
  - T5
  - T1
  - T4
- Salinity
  - T1/T4: 35
  - T2/T5: 36
  - T3/T6: 34
- Checked ammonia concentrations in all tanks
  - T1: 1.0
  - T2: 0
  - T3: 8.0
  - T4: 2.0
  - T5: 0
  - T6: 8.0
- Performed water change, cleaned, and added 1/2 tsp conditioner to T1, T3, T4, and T6
- Fed crabs 1/4 tsp in cold and ambient tanks, 3/8 tsp in warm tanks after respirometry

### Day 9

- Checked ammonia concentrations in all tanks
  - T1: 1.0
  - T2: 0.5
  - T3: 8.0
  - T4: 4.0
  - T5: 0.5
  - T6: 8.0
  - Carolyn: High ammonia concentrations in warm tanks consistent with what she experienced, continue doing water changes and monitoring. As long as crab behavior doesn't change it's probably fine
- Cleaned all tanks, performed water change for T3 and T6, and added 1/2 tsp conditioner to T1, T3, T4, and T6
- Replaced aquarium filters on all tanks
- No mortalities
- Fed all tanks 1/4 tsp
- T6 temperature holding closer to 29-30ºC on heater probes. Increased set point to 33ºC and reduced Hd and Cd to 0.2ºC. Will see if that stabilizes temperature and confirm with HOBOs

### Day 10

- Checked ammonia concentrations in all tanks
  - T1: 1.0
  - T2: 0.5
  - T3: 8.0
  - T4: 4.0
  - T5: 0.5
  - T6: 8.0
- Cleaned all tanks, performed water change for T3 and T6, and added 1/2 tsp conditioner to T1, T3, T4, and T6
- No mortalities
- Fed ambient and warm tanks 1/4 tsp, cold tanks 1/8 tsp
  - Saw T3 and T6 crabs eat!
- Got HOBO data
  - Adding tank to the left of T1 (in front of 10ºC line) seems to insulate it and reduce variation between T1 and T4
  - T3 and T6 holding 31-32ºC, attempted to reduce some variation within tanks by setting Hd and Cd to 0.2ºC on all heaters. Back heaters set at 33ºC, T6 front 33ºC, T3 front 32ºC
  - yrv_3, yrv_9, yrv_10 low battery (cold tanks)
- T6 temperature holding closer to 29-30ºC on heater probes. Increased set point to 33ºC and reduced Hd and Cd to 0.2ºC. Will see if that stabilizes temperature and confirm with HOBOs
- T3: one crab on top, T6: four crabs on top. Patched small hole in T6 mesh that allowed crabs to sit between mesh and glass lid

### Going forward

1. Continue with experiment
3. Check HOBOs and replace low battery loggers
2. Update protocols
3. Organize project repository and datasheets
