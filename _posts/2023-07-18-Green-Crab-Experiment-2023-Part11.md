- Cold room saga
  - Cold room slightly open when I entered...uh oh
  - Temperature was at 48ºF?! I called Rick who had someone sent down from facilities to check.
  - There was an ice blockage on the back of the fan unit in the room. They turned off the cooling system so the ice would thaw and the fan would be able to cool again.
  - Borrowed three chillers from the Aquaculture lab — one for each water bath — so I could keep tanks at temperature. Lauren helped me set up the chillers by attaching a pump to the inflow for each chiller and ensuring the outflow emptied into the bath.
