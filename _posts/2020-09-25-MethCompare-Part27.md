## Revisiting the manuscript

We got comments back from other co-authors so it's time to dive back into this project! To ease myself in, I started [reorganizing my files in the repository](https://github.com/hputnam/Meth_Compare/issues/91) and [creating a README map](https://github.com/hputnam/Meth_Compare/issues/95). It's a low priority task that's much easier than actually addressing comments on the text...so here we are.

I picked up where Shelly left off with the README map by assigning categories and number keys to all scripts in the [code README.md](https://github.com/hputnam/Meth_Compare/blob/master/code/README.md). I designated some scripts related to DMC genomic locations to an "exploratory" status and tagged those with a "100" prefix. Although there are two separate categories for methylation characterization and genomic location, my scripts for these categories are combined. I added that information in the README, but it may be useful at some point to separate those scripts. Again, low priority.

Once I was finished with the code directory, I moved on to output. We decided to split the output directory into three subdirectories: figures, supplemental material, and intermediate files. All the subdirectories that were once in the "analyses" folder needed to be moved and organized! I first went through my intermediate files and ensured these files were actually useful. I deleted a few that were truly intermediate files that could be generated by code, but wouldn't be too important to access immediately. Then, I renamed the directories with the category tag as the script that produced them, and updated [the README.md](https://github.com/hputnam/Meth_Compare/tree/master/output/intermediate-files). I also added the same organizational structure to the intermediate file README.md that the code README.md had, with breaks for each of the headers in the manuscript. Finally, I updated the figure and table links in the [figures README.md](https://github.com/hputnam/Meth_Compare/blob/master/output/figures/README.md) and the [supplemental material README.md](https://github.com/hputnam/Meth_Compare/blob/master/output/supplemental-material/README.md).

Feeling motivated to do something that was a higher priority, I tagged Katie in [this Github issue](https://github.com/hputnam/Meth_Compare/issues/68) to get her up to speed with the various decisions we made before selecting a statistical approach. She asked why we didn't use a contingency test for our data, which was [something we previously considered](https://yaaminiv.github.io/MethCompare-Part15/) before we [settled on multivariate and linear model analyses](https://yaaminiv.github.io/MethCompare-Part19/). Hopefully she can suggest a better statistical approach so I can clarify my manuscript sections!

### Going forward

1. Determine a valid statistical approach
2. Recharacterize CpG methylation based on Katie and Jon's comments
2. Address all other co-author comments
