I slipped up and didn't write December 2018 goals, but I have some shiny new goals for the first month of 2019!

### [November Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/November-2018-Goals/):

**DNR**:

- Resubmitted my paper to MEPS! The latest version can be found on bioRXiv [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/12/11/460204). This was primarily done in December and it was my only goal before the quarter ended.

**Virginica**:

- [Finished `bismark` alignment on Mox](https://yaaminiv.github.io/DML-Analysis-Part12/)
- [Ran `methylKit` and `bedtools` on alignments from Mox](https://yaaminiv.github.io/DML-Analysis-Part17/)
- Conducted [flanking analysis](https://yaaminiv.github.io/DML-Analysis-Part18/)
- Didn't touch gene enrichment

**Gigas Broodstock**:

- Did not solidify which kit to use for sample preparation (yet)

**Other**:

- Ran my second committee meeting! The committee is on board with me bypassing Winter 2019
- Outlined my PhD proposal
- Looked up bypass application requirements

### January Goals

**Virginica**:

- Find intersections betwen output from `methylKit unite` and genome feature files
- Proportion test for DML/DMR location against `unite` output
- See if SNP data or mapping efficiency contributes to poor PCA clustering
- Identify some form of gene enrichment or functional description
- Update methods and results

**Gigas Broodstock**:

- Identify which kit to use for DNA sequencing preparation
- Send samples for sequencing
- Determine if RNA can be isolated

**Bypass**:

- Finish draft Ph.D proposal
- Update CV
- Write bypass statement
- Send bypass application to committee for approval
- Submit bypass application

**Other**:

- Apply for Husky100
- Work on NSF GROW application
- Look into FHL TA application
