### [April Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/April-2018-Goals/):

**DNR**:

- Got feedback from Alex and Micah at the end of April!
- Didn't finalize the repository or submit the paper because I was busy with the Manchester paper.

**Manchester**:

- **I SUCESSFULLY CHANNELED MY INNER MAC AND WROTE AN ENTIRE PAPER IN 15 DAYS AND SUBMITTED IT ON TIME!**

**Virginica**:

- Took a subset of my sequencing data through [genome preparation](), [sequence alignment](), and [methylation extraction]() in `bismark`

**Other**: 

- Compiled a [list of Ph.D project ideas]() and discussed them with Steven
- Developed an [outreach activity]() for the SEAS 2018 Open House

### May Goals

**DNR**:

- Address Alex and Micah's feedback
- Send the draft to Steven, Emma, and Brent for final approval
- Compile my supplemental material and repository
- Submit the manuscript!

**Virginica**:

- Understand `methylkit` and MACAU 2.0 for differential methylation analyses
- Run a subset of samples through the pipeline for differential methylation analysis
- Start the pipeline with all samples
- Start writing methods and (maybe) results for Pubathon

**Larval Mortality**:

- Start analyzing larval mortality data in a robust way
- Prepare larvae and adults for MBDSeq and RNA analyses

**Other**:

- Outline my next few chapters!
