As the new year starts I'm entering the interpretation and writing state for a lot of my projects, so this orange cat speaks to me.

### [December Goals recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/December-2023-Goals/)

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- Conducted [multivariate metabolomics analysis](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-Part21/) and [functional enrichment](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-Part22/)!
- [Did the same thing with the lipidomics data!](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-Part23/)
- Drafted talk for SICB

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

- Finished interpreting gene lists! I (affectionately, I think) called it my  paper lockdown because I spent the majority of December working on this project.
- Outlined discussion

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

- one day...I'll actually work on this and meet my goals

**West Coast Green Crab Experiment**:

- [Revisited Julia's samples for genotyping](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2023-Part30/)
- Decided not to return to decontamination station since I'd be gone from the lab again, and would likely have to deal with a whole new set of environments

**Other**:

- Reviewed paper for PLOS Climate
- Reviewed paper for Biological Bulletin
- Wrote and submitted an AGA Special Event grant for RIE2

### January Goals

**West Coast Green Crab Experiment**:

- Return to decontamination station and get going again on extractions
- Train Vanessa in extraction and genotyping workflow

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

- Edit methods and results
- Revise discussion outline
- Write discussion
- Write abstract
- Outline introduction
- Write introduction

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- Update methods and results from metabolomics and lipidomics analyses
- Finalize metabolomics analysis
- Finalize lipidomics analysis
- Review green crab thermal physiology literature

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

- Finish `methylKit` contingency tests
- Conduct a randomization test for DML identification
- Integrate other epigenetic datasets
- Update methods and results
- Revise discussion

**Other**:

- Submit additional faculty applications
- Review NSF proposal
- Launch RIE2 survey
- Work on PRISMA searches for WOCinEEB Global Change collaboration

### Deep Freeze

Things that are not immediate enough to be on the backburner, so they're stuck in the deep freeze.

**Virginica Methylation and Expression**:

I'll return to this when I have an updated discussion for the Hawaii paper.

- Update methods and results from quadratic addition to transcriptional noise model
- Compare transcriptional noise analysis with Liew and Aranda papers

**Killifish Methylation and Expression**:

I'll return to this when I have a good draft of the coral paper.

- Pathway analysis for RNA-Seq data
- Determine protocol for SNP identification
- Conduct in silico RRBS digestion
- Characterize DEG that overlap between populations
- Quantify gene expression variability
- Visualize DEG data

**Zebrafish DNMT**:

I'll think about this once I have a robust killifish paper draft.

- Identify a stress condition to use for the zebrafish based on disease factors or conditions that are known to induce changes in methylation
- Determine physiological endpoints to assess for embryos
- Construct a project timeline
