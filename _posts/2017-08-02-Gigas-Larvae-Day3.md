title: Gigas Larvae Day 3

## Counting larvae takes a while

Before I get into that, a quick rundown of other things I did today.

- Recorded probe numbers in each larval bucket
  - 1: SN6 Amb pH A
  - 2: SN6 Low pH B
  - 3: SN6 Amb B
  - 5: NF6 Amb B
  - 6: NF10 Low pH A
  - 9: SN10 Low pH A
  - 10: SN10 Amb A
  - 11: SN6 Low pH A
  - 12: NF6 Amb A
  - 12: NF10 Amb B
  - 15: NF6 Low pH B
  - 17: NF10 Low pH B
  - 19: SN10 Low B
  - 21: NF6 Low pH A
  - 23: NF10 Amb A
- [Recorded which bucket was in which tote](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-oyster-oa/blob/master/data/2017-07-30-pacific-oyster-larvae/2017-07-31-Temperature.xlsx)

- Did not record morning temperatures
  - HOBOs already in tanks, no need
- Measured morning [food presence](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-oyster-oa/blob/master/data/2017-07-30-pacific-oyster-larvae/2017-07-30-Feeding.xlsx)
  - Very dense! I think this is because I fed in the afternoon on Tuesday, so the larvae didn't have a full 24 hours to really feed down

- Steven rigged up the AVTECH in the SeaLab, so I now have 5 probes to work with
- He also started messing around with the OA system set-up
- Moved immersion heater probes to inside larval bucket, instead of in tote
- Counted heaters
  - 8 new from Roberts Lab, 1 not being used right now
  - 2 old heaters (one I ordered, one I took from the lab with the Farenheight controller)
  - Gray heater borrowed from rick
- [Fed larvae](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-oyster-oa/blob/master/data/2017-07-30-pacific-oyster-larvae/2017-07-30-Feeding.xlsx)

Now to the main event: imaging and counting! I counted all of the larvae in Plate 1 collected [yesterday](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-oyster-oa/blob/master/data/2017-07-30-pacific-oyster-larvae/2017-08-02-Larvae-Counts.xlsx). It took me much longer than I expected, mainly because I was trying to figure out how to work the dissecting scope while also taking pictures for future use. My count data can be found [here](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-oyster-oa/blob/master/data/2017-07-30-pacific-oyster-larvae/2017-08-02-Larvae-Counts.xlsx).

There were lots of larvae that exhibited a normal D-hinge shape, but there were also some that looked like peanuts! I recorded how many of these deformed ones I saw as well.

I'm storing all of my larvae photos and videos from today [here](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-oyster-oa/tree/master/images/Gigas-larvae/2017-08-02). I'm cataloging each day in a different folder, and labelling which bucket the larvae are from in the image name.

For tomorrow:

- Screen with 60 and 48 micron screens
- Sample and count
- Save samples in -80ÂºC freezer
- Finish imaging Plate 2 and 3

Since you made it through this lab post, here are some easy links to larvae videos. Both are from bucket 8:
