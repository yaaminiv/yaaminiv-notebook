Turns out I'm not the greatest at working on projects while writing a grant proposals. I did some stuff last month but it wasn't all the stuff I said I would do so here's a recap of the stuff I did do:

### [January Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/January-2019-Goals/):

**Virginica**:

- Found [intersections betwen output from `methylKit unite` and genome feature files](https://yaaminiv.github.io/DML-Analysis-Part19/)
- Conducted a [proportion test for DML/DMR location against `unite` output](https://yaaminiv.github.io/DML-Analysis-Part20/)
- [Investigated my clustering](https://yaaminiv.github.io/DML-Analysis-Part21/), but decided it wasn't an important rabbit hole to go down
- Kept my methods and results updated

**Bypass**:

- Wrote my bypass statement

**Other**:

- Applied for Husky100
- Applied to teach Larval Biology at Friday Harbor in July
- Submitted NSF GROW application

### February Goals:

These are the things that got left behind last month, so now I can focus on them.

**Virginica**:

- Complete gene enrichment
- Describe genes DMRs are in
- Draft discussion and introduction

**Gigas Broodstock**:

- Identify which kit to use for DNA sequencing preparation by making a flowchart
- Send samples for sequencing
- Determine if RNA can be isolated

**Bypass**:

- Finish draft Ph.D proposal
- Update CV
- Send bypass application to committee for approval
- Submit bypass application
