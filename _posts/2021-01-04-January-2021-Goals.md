So...I guess I'm defending this year? My plan is to defend in June, which means I need to start wrapping stuff up and analyzing data! Last quarter I made it through the rest of my adult *C. virginica* gonad DNA and RNA extractions, and sent my adult *C. gigas* gonad DNA for WGBS. However...I still have labwork that needs to be finished and libraries that have yet to be sequenced. It's going to be a busy month (and quarter). 

### [December Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/December-2020-Goals/)

**Virginica Labwork**:

- [Finished extracting sperm DNA and RNA](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Virginica-Gonad-DNA-Extractions-Part13/)!
- Contacted Zymo for a quote but didn't hear back, so I didn't send anything for sequencing

**Coral Methylation Comparison**:

- Updated the methods and results with contingency test information
- Created an experimental design figure
- Contributed to the discussion section
- Finalized manuscript for NOAA internal review!

**Other**::

- [Examined associations between methylation island characteristics and GOterms in overlapping genes in *C. gigas*](https://yaaminiv.github.io/WGBS-Analysis-Part9/)
- [Put together a SICB talk, including burned on captions](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.9897719)!

### January Goals

**Hawaii Diploid/Triploid Methylation**:

- Trim data
- Run trimmed data through pipeline from the coral paper
- Identify differentially methylated loci associated with treatment and ploidy

**Gigas Gonad Methylation**:

- Trim data
- Run trimmed data through pipeline from the coral paper
- Identify differentially methylated loci in `methylKit`
- Determine if there are existing ATAC-Seq datasets that can be used to incorporate chromatin organization information

**Virginica Labwork**:

- Obtain WGBS and RNA-Seq quotes from Zymo
- Send sample for sequencing!
- Determine if there are any mantle samples that should be used for DNA/RNA extractions

**ATAC-Seq Labwork**:

- Purchase reagents and identify samples to test cell dissociation protocols
- Ensure protocol is easy to follow and is accessible for the lab
- Dissociate and cryopreserve some cells

**Gigas Labwork**:

- If there's some lag time while waiting for ATAC-Seq reagents and analyzing WGBS data, test RNA extraction protocol
- Extract RNA from samples sent for WGBS
- Send RNA for library preparation and sequencing
- Identify location of larval samples for potential extractions
