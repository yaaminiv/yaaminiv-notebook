## ...But now trouble is gone!

This morning I prepared another O107 sample using the [PRTC protocol](https://yaaminiv.github.io/PRTC-preparation/) to deal with [last night's mini-fiasco](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Mass-Spec-Update-2/).

Everything looks good now! I will talk with Emma to figure out why my original sample preparation didn't work.
