## My files are done converting!

I uploaded them OWL, so they can be found [here](http://owl.fish.washington.edu/spartina/DNR_MSConvert_20170417/).

Emma is going to run `pecanpie` for us because our lab computers take too long to run the program, and do not allow us to construct our runs the way we want. I sent her the following information:

[converted mzML files](http://owl.fish.washington.edu/spartina/DNR_MSConvert_20170417/)
[background proteome](http://owl.fish.washington.edu/spartina/DNR_PECAN_Run_3_20170308/Combined-digested-edited-gigas-QC_Mass400to6000.tabular)
[revised isolation scheme](http://owl.fish.washington.edu/spartina/DNR_MSConvert_20170417/2017_January_23_envtstress_oyster_isoscheme.txt)

Now I sit back and wait for `pecanpie` to work its magic. I'll replace the oyster seed .blib I used for [Skyline analyses](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Preliminary-Data-Analysis/) with the .blib this process generates and reanalyze my data.
