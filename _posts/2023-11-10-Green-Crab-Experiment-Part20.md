## Making a plan for metabolomics analysis

### Analytical workflow

Before I jumped into analysis, I surveyed some recent metabolomics papers to see if I could come up with a consensus on analytical method:

[Huffmyer et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.03.20.533475):

- PLS-DA in `mixOmics` package
- WCNA with WGCNA correlated to identify with coral developmental time points
- analyzed for enrichment of compound class and KEGG pathway with MetaboAnalyst web interface

[Williams et al. (2021)](https:/doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abd4210):

- DGCA for correlation of metabolite pairs between ambient and stressed Mcap
- Significant correlations â€”> used to create co-occurrence networks

[Noisette et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/metabo11090584):

- PCA then PLS-DA
- VIP identified from PLS-DA
- ANOVA for differences in metabolites between groups
- functional enrichment and pathway topology analysis (takes into account role of metabolite, position, and direction of interaction in a network)
- MetaboAnalyst used for all analyses

[Trigg et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-46947-6):

- All analyses in R except for PLS-DA and random forest analyses in MetaboAnalyst
- Remove compounds detected in less than half of crabs prior to downstream analyses
- univariate analyses: two-way ANOVA for each compound (OA + DO), Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction. sig compounds (model ANOVA < 0.01 and effect < 0.05 w/o FDR correction) used for pathway analyses
- multivariate: normalized by mean-centering and scaling, PLS-DA with default settings
- Metamapp: map metabolite relationships

Looks like a PLS-DA and some sort of MetaboAnalyst enrichment are common place, so I'll start there! Huffmyer et al. (2023) has the most recent scripts available on Github, so I'll base a lot of my work off of that.

### Going forward

1. Analyze metabolomics data
