### [September Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/September-2018-Goals/):

**Manchester**:

- I finished addressing reviewer comments! The manuscript is almost finalized for resubmission.

**Virginica**:

- I presented [my preliminary results](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-virginica-oa/blob/master/presentations/Venkataraman_WED_1030.pptx) at PCSGA!
- Worked on in [`compGO`](https://yaaminiv.github.io/DML-Analysis-Part9/) and [DAVID](https://yaaminiv.github.io/DML-Analysis-Part8/), but my methods are most likely wrong
- Didn't make much headway writing because the gene enrichment stuff was confusing enough

**Gigas Broodstock**:

- Perfected a [DNA extraction protocol](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Gigas-Broodstock-DNA-Extraction-Part6/) and [posted it](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/blob/master/protocols/DNA-Extraction-from-Histology-Blocks.md)
- Extracted DNA from the [first batch of samples](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Gigas-Broodstock-DNA-Extraction-Part8/)

### October Goals

**Manchester**:

- Re-submit. That. Paper.

**DNR**:

- Address minor reviewer comments
- Address major comments
- Try using multivariate methods to explore relationship between environmental data and protein expression data
- Upload proteomics data to online databases
- Reformat the [paper repository](https://github.com/RobertsLab/paper-gigas-DNR-proteomics)

**Gigas Broodstock**:

- Finish extracting broodstock DNA
- Identify sequencing protocol
- Prepare samples for bisulfite sequencing

**Virginica**

- Rework `bismark` and `methylKit` to solidfy analysis parameters
- Present more solid findings to Eastern oyster methylation project group
- Update methods and results
- Fix gene enrichment methods
