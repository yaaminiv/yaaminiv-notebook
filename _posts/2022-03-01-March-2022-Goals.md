Just when I thought I had things under control, I have a slight change to the projects I'm working on!

### [February Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/February-2022-Goals/)

**Gigas Gonad Methylation**:

- [Clarified role of C->T SNP removal](https://yaaminiv.github.io/WGBS-Analysis-Part37/)
- [Uploaded data to NCBI SRA](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Uploding-to-NCBI-SRA/)
- FINISHED THE MANUSCRIPT!
- Waiting on a few clarifications prior to submission to a journal and bioRXiv

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

- Continued testing the extraction protocol

**Killifish Methylation and Expression**:

- [Started QC for trimeed methylation data, but ran into a corrupted file issue](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Killifish-Hypoxia-RRBS-Part2/)

**Ocean Acidification and Reproduction Review**:

- Revised the discussion section
- Started a full read-through of the main text and supplementary material

**Other**:

- Contributed to eelgrass transcriptomics paper
- Worked more on potential project logistics with Neel and Chris

### March goals

**Gigas Gonad Methylation**:

- Submit manuscript!

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

- Identify a reliable extraction protocol
- Extract all samples possible

**Killifish Methylation and Expression**:

- Figure out issue with corrupted sample
- Start mapping methylation data

**Virginica Methylation and Expression**:

- Update extraction methods
- Update extraction results
- Work on `mixOmics` SPLS

**Other**:

- Submit ocean acidification and reproduction review
- Submit eelgrass transcriptomics abstract
- Finalize logistics for zebrafish and silverside projects
- Send out postdoctoral mentorship survey
- Coordinate pre-application postdoctoral mentoring program
- Apply to any relevant faculty positions, funding opportunities, or postdocs

### Deep Freeze

Things that are not immediate enough to be on the backburner, so they're stuck in the deep freeze.

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

- Address Rajan's edits
- Review `DSS` script and determine if I should go back to `methylKit` for better interpretation
- Extract SNPs with `EpiDiverse` and create a relatedness matrix
- Look at methylation islands and non-methylated regions
- Examine overlaps between DML and other epigenomic datasets from Sascha
