- Cleaned all tanks and fed all crabs
- 25-112 from T6 escaped! Added small rocks to the lids of all 15ºC and 25ºC to prevent crabs from escaping.

- T11 still super disgusting. T1 cloudy
- Replaced all nitrogen filters. Need to order more.

**7/10/23**:

- Cleaned, replaced 60% of water, and ammonia tested all tanks. Tanks with ammonia > 1.0 had conditioner added
  - T1: 0.5

- Julia deep cleaned and added ammonia conditioner to T10, T11, and T12. Also inventoried crab numbers still in those tanks so she can use them for her experiment.
- Discussed summer project logistics with Julia based on her availability, need to genotype, and days she's working remotely
- TTR on all tanks, then fed
- Found 5-075!! So the mystery crab is 5-060.
- Updated TTR spreadsheet
- Updated ammonia spreadsheet
- Updates survivorship spreadsheet

**7/11/23**:

- Obtained HOBO data for all tanks. Looks good!
  - T1A low battery
- T8 looked cloudy. Only 11 crabs...plus the label for 15-165! It's a crab horror movie.
  - T1: 11
  - T2: 11

  - T8: 11
  - T9: 10
  - T10: 12
  - T11: 10
  - T12: 13
- Updated survivorship
- Updated crab metadata with dead day

### Going forward

1. Continue doing daily checks and with experimental time points
2. Test formatting and analysis for one set of respirometry data
7. Respirometry analysis
8. Update methods
9. Update results
10. Cover respirometry chambers with black trash bags and duct tape, and add the probe holders with silicone glue
