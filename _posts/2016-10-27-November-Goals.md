title: November 2016 Goals
---

#### Now that it's almost November, it's time to get cracking on the [DNR project](https://yaaminiv.github.io/DNR-Project-Introduction/).

For this month, I would like to start and complete DNA extractions from oyster samples so we can run epigenetic tests. I would also like to establish a plan for protein extractions that can be completed before I leave for break in December.
Additionally, I will prepare a proposal talk about this project for the Graduate Student Symposium on November 17.
