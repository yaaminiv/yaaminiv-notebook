## Trippin for Trypsin

It's #TrypsinTuesday! The purpose of this step is to breakdown, or digest, our proteins into peptides.

After talking with Emma yesterday, we realized the [protocol](https://github.com/sr320/LabDocs/blob/master/protocols/ProteinprepforMSMS.md) we've been following is specific for larvae and not oyster tissue. Because of this, the protein concentrations we obtained yesterday were too dilute. To compensate for this, we're only using sample with 30 µg for 100 µL total volume. Additionally, we needed to modify the protocol for the amount of enzymes used (Lys-C and Trypsin). We divided the amount in the original protocol (made for 100µg protein for 100 µL sample) by three to account for the change in our methods.

#### **Here are the protein concentrations we calculated in after the BCA assay**:

**Table 1**: Volume of sample and 50mM in 6M Urea needed. Sample volume for 30 µg of protein were rounded up to the nearest whole number.

There are several reagents involved in digestion. A handful of them were [made by Rhonda](https://github.com/sr320/LabDocs/blob/master/protocols/ProteinprepforMSMS.md) and were viable for our use: TCEP, 1.5M Tris pH 8.8, IAA,  DTT and Lys-C. Trypsin was purchased since Rhonda used all of it during her lab work.
