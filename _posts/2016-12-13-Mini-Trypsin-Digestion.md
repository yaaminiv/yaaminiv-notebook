## Trippin for Trypsin

It's #TrypsinTuesday! After talking with Emma yesterday, we realized the [protocol](https://github.com/sr320/LabDocs/blob/master/protocols/ProteinprepforMSMS.md) we've been following is specific for larvae and not oyster tissue. Because of this, the protein concentrations we obtained yesterday were too dilute. To compensate for this, we're only using sample with 30 µg for 100 µL total volume. Additionally, we needed to modify the protocol for the amount of enzymes used (Lys-C and Trypsin). We divided the amount in the original protocol (made for 100µg protein for 100 µL sample) by three to account for the change in our methods.

#### **Here are the protein concentrations we calculated in after the BCA assay**:

**Table 1**: Volume of sample and 50mM in 6M Urea needed. Sample volume for 30 µg of protein were rounded up to the nearest whole number. 

| **Sample** | **µL of Sample Required For 30µg Protein** | **µL of 50mM NH4HCO3 in 6M Urea to add** |
