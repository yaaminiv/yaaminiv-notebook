title: SRM Dilution Calculations 2

## Revised for the last time

Today I went to UWPR to make the dilutions. Last night, Laura told me that she diluted our PRTC to 200 fmol/µL, so I had to account for that when making dilutions. The first thing I did was revise my dilution calculations with the new PRTC stock concentration. Because I needed to add more PRTC to each sample, I changed the injection volume from 1 µL to 2 µL for the 10:1 dilution. This means Laura has to pipet 0.375 µL of geoduck, which is less than 0.5 µL. Because Laura and I have pipetted this volume before and it's only for one sample, I think it is okay. Before I went down, I took 0.1 µL and 0.5 µL pipets from the lab.

**Table 1**. Revised dilution calculations

| **Vial** | **Dilution Ratio** | **µg to Inject** | **µL to Inject** | **µg oyster Needed** | **µg geoduck Needed** | **µL oyster needed ((µg/µL)x15 µL/1 µg/µL)** | **µL geoduck needed ((µg/µL)x15 µL/2 µg/µL)** | **PRTC added** | **µL  ACN** | **Total Volume (µL)** |

I then created 25 µL of my pooled oyster solution by adding 5 µL of the samples I selected [here](https://yaaminiv.github.io/SRM-Assay-Day9/). 

- O14
- O39
- O96
- O124
- O137

Using the volumes in Table 1, I prepared the vials by adding my oyster sample, PRTC and ACN. I left the labelled vials in the freezer for Laura to add her samples to.
