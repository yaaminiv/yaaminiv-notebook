## Treatment Days 23-26

**7/21/23**:

- Quick vacuum and feed
- No mortalities!
  - T1: 11
  - T2: 11
  - T3: 11
  - T4: 12
  - T5: 10
  - T6: 9
  - T7: 11
  - T8: 11
  - T9: 9
  - T10: 12
  - T11: 10
  - T12: 11
- Purchased more immersion heaters for Julia's experiment.

**7/22/23**:

- Ammonia check and replaced 60% of water in all tanks. Added conditioner when ammonia ≥ 1
  - T1: 1.0
  - T2: 0.5
  - T3: 8.0
  - T4: 1.0
  - T5: 8.0
  - T6: 8.0
  - T7: 0.5
  - T8: 1.0
  - T9: 8.0
- 15-160 dead in T8
  - T1: 11
  - T2: 11
  - T3: 11
  - T4: 12
  - T5: 10
  - T6: 9
  - T7: 11
  - T8: 10
  - T9: 9
  - T10: 12
  - T11: 10
  - T12: 11
- Experiment maintenance for Lauren's crabs
  - Replaced filters
  - Fed all crabs
  - Noted any mortalities
  - Used refractometer to measure salinity. If the salinity was > 2 or < 2 ppt away from the target salinity, I did a 60% water change.

**7/23/23**:

- Got filter cartridges. Replaced filters in T8 and T9 because they were *disgusting*.
- Vacuumed and fed all tanks
- Refilled water in cold room baths so the pumps wouldn't run dry
- 10-149 dead in T12, 5-134 dead in T7
  - T1: 11
  - T2: 11
  - T3: 11
  - T4: 12
  - T5: 10
  - T6: 9
  - T7: 10
  - T8: 10
  - T9: 9
  - T10: 12
  - T11: 10
  - T12: 10
- Experiment maintenance for Lauren's crabs
  - Fed all crabs
  - Noted any mortalities
  - Used refractometer to measure salinity. If the salinity was > 2 or < 2 ppt away from the target salinity, I did a 60% water change.

**7/24/23**:

- TTR for all 5ºC, 15ºC, and 25ºC tanks
- Sampled two crabs after TTR from each tank. If a crab heart was too small to be split, it was saved for metabolomics instead of transcriptomics
- A very fun labelling saga. 15-043 was listed as sampled on 6/29, but it was 100% sampled today because we CLEARLY saw the label as 15-043. Based on tank inventory in T2, it meant either 15-042 or 15-045 was sampled on 6/29 instead (we couldn't read the last number of the label very clearly). My guess is that 15-045 was sampled because the carapace width of the mystery crab was 53 mm, which is exactly what we had down for 15-042.
  - I updated all relevant spreadsheets to reflect this. At some point, I'll need to note down which tube numbers are incorrectly labelled for crabs that were sampled based on my notes.
- No mortalities! But two crabs were sampled from each tank for a one month metabolomics timepoint.
  - T1: 9
  - T2: 9
  - T3: 9
  - T4: 10
  - T5: 8
  - T6: 7
  - T7: 8
  - T8: 8
  - T9: 7
  - T10: 12
  - T11: 10
  - T12: 10
- Got HOBO data from all tanks
  - Low battery: t1a, t9a

### Going forward

1. Continue doing daily checks and with experimental time points
2. Assist Lauren and Julia with experiments
2. Test formatting and analysis for one set of respirometry data
7. Respirometry analysis
8. Update methods
9. Update results
