We're continuing the trend of getting things done and off of my plate! There are a handful of projects that are in final analysis/writing stage that I'm hoping to get wrapped up before experiments start this summer.

### [March Goals recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/March-2024-Goals/)

**Virginica Methylation and Expression**:

- [Counted DML in genes with a predominant isoform shift](https://yaaminiv.github.io/CEABiGR-Part13/)
- [Analyzed changes in the maximum number of transcripts expressed](https://yaaminiv.github.io/CEABiGR-Part14/)
- [Performned enrichment analyses for relevant datasets](https://yaaminiv.github.io/CEABiGR-Part15/)
- [Compared enrichment results across tests and read relevant papers](https://yaaminiv.github.io/CEABiGR-Part16/)
- Create all figures in [this issue](https://github.com/sr320/ceabigr/issues/89)
- SUBMITTED MANUSCRIPT!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**West Coast Green Crab Experiment**:

- Finished extractions and PCR for most crabs with an associated sample and sent them for sequencing!
- Taught Vanessa how to use Sequencher to analyze genotype data

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- Read some more green crab thermal physiology literature and percolated on my metabolomics analysis

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

- Finalized abstract

**Other**:

- Supervised Sophia's data extraction
- Sent papers to the appropriate groups
- Submitted GSA Starter Microculture grant for RIE2

### April Goals

**Green crab Pilot Experiment**

- Revise metabolomics analysis
- Revise lipidomics analysis
- Update all methods and results

**West Coast Green Crab Experiment**:

- Finish all extractions, PCR, and gels
- Send remaining samples for sequencing

**Killifish Methylation and Expression**:

- Update methods
- Update results
- Update figures
- Make list of additional analyses needed
- Outline discussion points

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

- Write discussion

**Other**:

- Plan summer experiment
- Plan RIE2 hackathon
- Advertise RIE2 database
- Book flights for SEB

### Deep Freeze

Things that are not immediate enough to be on the backburner, so they're stuck in the deep freeze.

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

I'll return to this when I have a good draft of the coral paper.

- Finish `methylKit` contingency tests
- Conduct a randomization test for DML identification
- Integrate other epigenetic datasets
- Update methods and results
- Revise discussion

**Zebrafish DNMT**:

I'll think about this once I have a robust killifish paper draft.

- Identify a stress condition to use for the zebrafish based on disease factors or conditions that are known to induce changes in methylation
- Determine physiological endpoints to assess for embryos
- Construct a project timeline
