title: Skyline Error Checking Round 2
---

## This time it only took 4 hours!

Due to a combination of not working late at night, using the same proteins and transitions as [last time](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Skyline-Error-Checking/), and knowing what good and bad peaks look like, I was able to spot check 100 peptides in the [revised Skyline document](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Skyline-Attempt-3/). Because I was in a rush to finish and head to the airport, I didn't take any side-by-side comparison pictures. I do however, have revised error rates.

Ovearll, I think the new .blib improved Skyline peak selection. I haven't compared error rates so I don't have anything quantitative to base my assertion on, but I have a few observations:

- More instances of a peak being chosen correctly for all replicates
- Way less missing peaks
- Fewer noisy peak selections

The previous error checking document is [here](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-oyster-oa/blob/master/analyses/DNR_Skyline_20170512/error-checking/2017-05-13-error-checking.txt), revised error checking document can be found [here](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-oyster-oa/blob/master/analyses/DNR_Skyline_20170524/error-checking/2017-06-10-error-checking.xlsx).

After error checking, I re-exported my Skyline reports.
