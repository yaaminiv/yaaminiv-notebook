Let's see how those August Goals played out.

### August Goals recap

- [The larvae died](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Gigas-Larvae-Day18/). But I think there's still a cool story to tell from it!
- I didn't have time to analyze my SRM data because of the hectic days at Manchester
- Steven and I hashed out funding options and a goal to have my first committee meeting after PCSGA

Now for this month:

- Analyze SRM data for PCSGA!
- Write my first complete draft of the oyster proteomics paper
- Revise proposal to include what happened at Manchester
- Revise plan of study
- Schedule first committee meeting
