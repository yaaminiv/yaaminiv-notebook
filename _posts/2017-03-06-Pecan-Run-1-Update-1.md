title: PECAN Update 1

## Hit an obstacle with PECAN this weekend.

On Saturday, I used `ssh` to examine `pecanpie` progress on Roadrunner. I saw this...

![PECAN-1-complete](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RobertsLab/project-oyster-oa/master/analyses/DNR_PECAN_20170228/PECAN-inputs/PECAN-Run-1-complete.png)

...and thought I was done!

However, [Sean checked the PECAN log file](https://genefish.wordpress.com/2017/03/04/pecan-on-roadrunner-isnt-working-correctly/) and saw that there were no MS2 files scanned. Lots of [discussion on Github](https://github.com/sr320/LabDocs/issues/508) ensued. There are a few possibilities:

1. My raw files were not properly converted, and the data `pecanpie` is looking for, the MS2 files, are not present.
2. Everything worked out fine, and this is just an artifact of the analyses!

Interestingly enough, using `pecanpie` already requires the use of a typo for the isolation scheme (specifying "BOARDER" instead of the correctly spelled "BORDER"). Maybe our paucity of PECAN understanding is making this all seem more complicated then it is!
I talked to Sam and came up wtih a game plan going forward:

1. Reconvert 1 raw file to an mzML format using the command line verson of MSConvert. The [Evernote tutorial](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s347/sh/edcb06ab-d008-418f-b28f-52f6614f1c39/2984ab55f427fcfe) suggests this may be an issue.
2. Concurrently, explore the .blib file that was generated by `pecanpie` in Skyline. If this file has data, then everything should be fine!

Really hoping we fall into scenario 2 :pray:
