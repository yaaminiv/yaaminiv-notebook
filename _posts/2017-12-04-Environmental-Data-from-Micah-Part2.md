title: Environmental Data from Micah Part 2

## The last bit of data!

(I think).

Micah sent over [growth data](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-oyster-oa/blob/master/data/DNR/2017-12-05-OysterGrowth.csv) for the oysters, as well as site rankings for outplant depth and eelgrass extent in the bay.

> Outplant elevation, from deepest to most shallow: Case Inlet (never dry), Fidalgo Bay (never dry), Skokomish (exposed at low tide), Port Gamble Bay (exposed at low tide), Willapa Bay (frequently exposed at low tide)

> Eelgrass extent in bay, from most to least: Fidalgo Bay (eelgrass dominant), Willapa Bay (eelgrass dominant), Port Gamble Bay (eelgrass common), Case Inlet (eelgrass common), Skokomish (eelgrass limited)
