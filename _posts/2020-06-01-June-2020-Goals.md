2020 keeps destroying my cabbages but here I am still working. Since I hope to start labwork next month, most of my goals will center around wrapping up writing projects and preparing for lab.

### **[May Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/May-2020-Goals/)**:

**Coral Methylation Comparison**:

- [Created a flanking track and revised my intergenic track](https://yaaminiv.github.io/MethCompare-Part14/). We're still working on getting the RepeatMasker transposable element tracks for each genome, but that's a low priority right now.
- I [created figures and conduct statistical analysis for CpG distributions in both species](https://yaaminiv.github.io/MethCompare-Part16/)...but they may be flawed. At least the pipeline is there!
- Update methods and results of paper

**Gigas and Virginica Labwork**:

- [Created a labwork plan and cost spreadsheet](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Proposed-Gigas-and-Virginica-Labwork/)!

**Other**:

- PASSED MY GENERAL EXAM!!!!!!!
- Updated my Ph.D proposal and sent it to Amy. No more milestones!
