It's August, which means I only have a month left to wrap up my summer goals! I've been making good progress with the students, but once they leave I'll be able to focus on my own work a bit more.

### [June (and July) Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/June-2024-Goals/)

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- Didn't work on any analysis, but I did get some good ideas on how to move forward from SEB. Ariana and I also chatted about methods so I think I have a clear plan!

**West Coast Green Crab Experiment**:

- ...yeah I didn't do anything with this.

**Cold Acclimation Green Crab Experiment**:

- Tried to genotype the MA crabs but kept [running into issues with DNA extractions not working](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2024-Part16/). Just your standard labwork curse.
- [Ran the MA experiment](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2024-Part13/)!
- [Used mixed effects models to analyze the MA data](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2024-Part17/)
- [Developed heart rate protocol](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2024-Part20/)! I wasn't able to use heart rate in the experiment, but now I know how to do it.
- [Started troubleshooting a lipid assay](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2024-Part21/). I initially thought Heidi could use the lipid data as part of her experiment, but based on the trials we're having getting blanks to run well, it doesn't seem like that's a possibility.
- [Ran the WA experiment](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2024-Part20/)!

**Killifish Methylation and Expression**:

- [Finished characterizing general methylation landscape](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Killifish-Hypoxia-RRBS-Part26/)
- [Examined genomic locations of DMR](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Killifish-Hypoxia-RRBS-Part27/)
- Updated methods and results

**Other**:

- Supervised Catlin and Heidi as they did their summer experiments and started analyzing data!
- Launched RIE2 working group initiative
- Presented my poster at SEB!
- Worked on CEABiGR reviewer comments

### August Goals

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- Finalize metabolomics analysis
- Finalize lipidomics analysis
- Update methods
- Update results
- Outline discussion

**West Coast Green Crab Experiment**:

- Update summer notebook
- Identify samples for metabolomics and lipidomics sequencing
- If time
  - Genotype-specific mortality analysis
  - Start manuscript

**Cold Acclimation Green Crab Experiment**:

- Analyze WA TTR data
- Return to troubleshooting DNA extractions
- Outline manuscript

**Killifish Methylation and Expression**:

- Examine DMR-DEG overlaps
- Create DMR figure
- Identify SNPs in DMR
- Update methods and results

**Other**:

- Supervise Catlin and Heidi as they analyze data and make their final presentations!
- Submit SICB abstract for short-term acclimation paper
- Update CV
- Create job application schedule
- Submit CEABiGR paper revision
- Write NSF ORCC project summary
- Send project summary to program officer and potential collaborators

### Deep Freeze

Things that are not immediate enough to be on the backburner, so they're stuck in the deep freeze.

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

These are things I need to do and can probably knock out in a week, but I think they're a lower priority right now for me since there's more momentum on other projects.

- Revise abstract
- Write discussion
- Write introduction

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

I'll return to this when I have a good draft of the coral paper.

- Finish `methylKit` contingency tests
- Conduct a randomization test for DML identification
- Integrate other epigenetic datasets
- Update methods and results
- Revise discussion
