## Treatment Days 18 through 22

### Day 18

- Checked ammonia concentrations in all tanks
  - T1: 1.0
  - T2: 0.25
  - T3: 8.0
  - T4: 1.0
  - T5: 0.25
  - T6: 8.0
- Cleaned all tanks, performed water change for all tanks, and added 1/2 tsp conditioner to T1, T3, T4, and T6
- T3: 1 crab on top; T6: 2 crabs on top
- 2 dead crabs in T6 (1 YG M, 1 YG F)
- Fed ambient and warm tanks 1/4 tsp, cold tanks 1/8 tsp
- Time-to-right for seven crabs in each tank
- Obtained HOBO data
  - yrv_4, yrv_10, yrv_13 low battery but still recording

### Day 19

- Checked ammonia concentrations in all tanks
  - T1: 2.0
  - T2: 1.0
  - T3: 8.0
  - T4: 2.0
  - T5: 1.0
  - T6: 8.0
- Cleaned all tanks, performed water change for T3 and T6, and added 1/2 tsp conditioner to all tanks
- Fed ambient and warm tanks 1/4 tsp, cold tanks 1/8 tsp
- LED light didn't turn by itself

### Day 20

- Checked ammonia concentrations in all tanks
  - T1: 1.0
  - T2: 0.25
  - T3: 8.0
  - T4: 1.0
  - T5: 0.25
  - T6: 8.0
- Cleaned all tanks, performed water change for T3 and T6, and added 1/2 tsp conditioner to ambient and warm tanks
- Fed ambient and warm tanks 1/4 tsp initially, cold tanks 1/8 tsp. Fed an extra 1/4 tsp to ambient and warm tanks since there was no food left in the tanks when I went to clean
- T6: turbid and bad smell
  - 3 dead crabs: 2 Y/YO males, 1 O female (color on carapace fading after death)
- LED light didn't turn by itself

### Day 21

- Checked ammonia concentrations in all tanks
  - T1: 1.0
  - T2: 0.50
  - T3: 8.0
  - T4: 1.0
  - T5: 0.50
  - T6: 8.0
- Cleaned all tanks, performed water change for all tanks, and added 1/2 tsp conditioner to ambient and warm tanks
- All food eaten in ambient tanks, food still remaining in warm tanks
- T3: 1 orange male dead
- T6: Temperature got too low after cleaning tank (turned heaters off while cleaning to drain water without exposing heater). Turned heaters back on, temperature rising when leaving.

### Day 22

- Protocol for today
  - Performed TTR for all crabs. Sexed, gauged color, measured, and weighed each sampled crab, then labelled each crab with a number. Based on weight (20-30 g), we selected crabs for respirometry.
  - Acclimated three selected crabs for one hour
  - Measured oxygen consumption. The goal was to measure consumption until the chambers reached 75-80% oxygen.
  - Removed crabs from the respirometry chambers. Resealed the chamber and measured background respiration for 20 minutes. Empty chambers and wipe down with 70% ethanol.
  - Use refractometer to get salinity measurement for acclimation tank
  - Obtained HOBO data
  -  Notes
    - Usually set up acclimation for one tank while performing TTR for the next tank
    - Recalibrated probes before each respirometry run
    - T6: 1 F YO
    - T6 reading at 22ÂºC at the beginning of the day
      - Turned both heaters on and off, still reading too low.
      - Finished T3 tank first and then moved T6 crabs to T3 to measure last and retain at a warmer temperature
      - Temperature was too low for one whole day, meaning that the tank never reached the appropriate temperature after I left the day before. Oops.
- Tank order
  - T3
  - T2
  - T5
  - T1
  - T4
  - T6
- Salinity
  - T1/T4: 35
  - T2/T5: 34
  - T3/T6: 35
  - Checked ammonia concentrations in all tanks
    - T1: 1.0
    - T2: 0.25
    - T3: 8.0
    - T4: 1.0
    - T5: 0.25
    - T6: 8.0
- Took down the experimental set-up and cleaned everything!

### Going forward

1. Update protocols
3. Organize project repository and datasheets
3. Update methods
4. Start analysis!
