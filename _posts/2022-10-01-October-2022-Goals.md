September was a *doozy*. It set the pace for what's proving to be an absurdly busy fall, between making progress on multiple projects and applying to faculty jobs! Hopefully there's room for some disco amongst all the panic.

### [September Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/September-2022-Goals/)

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

- Finalized the differential expression analysis
- Annotated the differentially expressed gene list and started digging through results
- Completed gene enrichment analysis
- Started compiling lists of relevant papers

**Killifish Methylation and Expression**:

- [Completed alignment to the new genome](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Killifish-Hypoxia-RRBS-Part20/)
- [Continued the RRBS workflow with the new genome alignments](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Killifish-Hypoxia-RRBS-Part21/)
- [Reviewed RNA-Seq data](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Killifish-Hypoxia-RRBS-Part21/)
- Decided against presenting this data at EPIMAR because the methylation story was not clear

**Virginica Methylation and Expression**:

- [Returned to SPLS anlysis](https://yaaminiv.github.io/CEABiGR-Part6/)...but wasn't able to get results because of `mox` issues

**Faculty Applications**

- Revised my research, teaching, and DEI statements
- Submitted three applications!

**Other**:

- Finished addressing reviewer comments on ocean acidification and reproduction review. Our review was accepted!

### October Goals

**Virginica Methylation and Expression**:

- Finish SPLS analysis for gene methylation and expression
- Conduct predominant isoform analysis
- Conduct transcriptional noise analysis
- Present results at EPIMAR
- Determine which other hypotheses should be tested

**Killifish Methylation and Expression**:

- Test `BAT_DMRcorrelating` to match RRBS and RNA-Seq data
- Conduct pathway analysis for RNA-Seq data
- Investigate SNP associations with RRBS data
- Look into mQTL analysis
- Start RRBS mapping with new genome
- Update methods and results
- Compile results for UMass Dartmouth seminar
- Put together APS talk

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- Figure out which parts of the analysis Sara and Mikayla can work on
- Analyze survivorship data by treatment and sex
- Analyze time-to-right data by treatment, sex, weight, and integument color
- Update methods and results
- Determine workflow for respiration data analysis
- Determine workflow for metabolomics sample processing
- Compile results for UMass Dartmouth seminar

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

- Dig into annotated genes
- Conduct WGCNA on the cluster

**Other**:

- Finish addressing reviewer comments on ocean acidification and reproduction review
- Distribute results of postdoctoral mentorship experiences survey
- Launch the postdoctoral mentoring program

### Deep Freeze

Things that are not immediate enough to be on the backburner, so they're stuck in the deep freeze.

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

I will revisit this paper after EPIMAR.

- Address Rajan's edits
- Return to `methylKit` for better interpretation
- Extract SNPs with `EpiDiverse` and create a relatedness matrix
- Look at methylation islands and non-methylated regions
- Examine overlaps between DML and other epigenomic datasets from Sascha

**Zebrafish DNMT**:

I'll think about this once I have a robust killifish paper draft.

- Identify a stress condition to use for the zebrafish based on disease factors or conditions that are known to induce changes in methylation
- Determine physiological endpoints to assess for embryos
- Construct a project timeline
