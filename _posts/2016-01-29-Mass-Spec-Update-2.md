title: Mass Spec Update #2
---

## ...And trouble stuck around at 3:51 p.m. on January 29.

After the success with the mass spec [this morning](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Mass-Spec-Updates/), I thought everything would be fine with the sample I had to rerun! When I checked it, the raw data looked...odd.

I decided to run it again (third times a charm, right?), but got this instead.

I will need to [prepare another 15 ÂµL of sample](https://yaaminiv.github.io/PRTC-preparation/) and bring it down to the mass spec tomorrow morning. Hopefully that works!
