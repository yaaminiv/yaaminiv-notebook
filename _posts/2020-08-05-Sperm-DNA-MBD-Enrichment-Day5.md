## Continuing shearing and quality checks

We got BioAnalyzer chips on Friday, so it's time to run more chips! I took the dilutions I [made previously (1:100 for sample 57, 1:20 for all other samples)](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Sperm-DNA-MBD-Enrichment-Day4/) and loaded them onto the chip. My run (thankfully) was successful!

**Figures 1-2**. Electropherogram and gel for resheared samples

Most of my samples have peaks around 300-400 bp, which is good for the MethylMiner kit. Samples 6 and 63 have peaks around 1000 bp, so I ran them for five cycles (30 seconds on, 30 seconds off). I wasn't sure about sample 12, which has a significant amount of DNA that's sheared correctly but also some DNA that's longer. I posted [this issue](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/983) to get Sam's opinion about reshearing. I figured I'd hold off on running samples 63 and 6 on the BioAnalyzer until 1) I confirm if I need to shear more samples and 2) I conduct an [isopropanol precipitation with *C. gigas* gonad DNA samples](https://yaaminiv.github.io/WGBS-Samples-Part4/) so I can conserve BioAnalyzer chips.

### Going forward

1. Finish shearing and quality checks
2. Dilute samples to 25 ng/ÂµL
3. Prepare reagents for MethylMiner kit (1X Buffer) and label tubes
4. Process *C. virginica* sperm samples in two batches with MethylMiner kit
5. Complete ethanol precipitation with all *C. virginica* sperm samples
