title: Environmental Data from Micah
---

## More data, more problems...?

Micah sent over the [salinity data](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-oyster-oa/blob/master/data/DNR/2017-11-25-Calculated-Salinity-Output-from-Micah.xlsx). He said there are instrumental issues, and that we need to clip out any data from "low tide/exposure." He uses [this website](http://tbone.biol.sc.edu/tide/) for tidal data. He also misspoke, and there were no chlorophyll sensors in the 2016 deployment.

He should have depth data for the following as well, but he didn't have it at the moment. He said he will send more information over when he's back in town on Wednesday.
