## Tryna make the most out of this short month

**[January Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/January-2018-Goals/)**:

- Successfully turned in a draft of [my proteomics paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1giP16iXWPE7oDSNI7fyLV3p_1jqsXuuxlH7cJQAwhLM/edit?pli=1#heading=h.7vvlns7jaib)! I got some feedback form Emma, Brent and Steven
- I'm almost done with my *C. virginica* MBD-Seq. I [sheared DNA](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Virginica-MBDSeq/), [prepared reagents for labwork](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Virginica-MBDSeq-Day2/), [bound DNA to the beads](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Virginica-MBDSeq-Day3/), and started the [ethanol precipitation](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Virginica-MBDSeq-Day4/). 
- Sam said that I'll have to wait a few months to get sequencing data back, so I didn't focus too much on a plan for *C. virginica* post-sequencing.
- It also means I probably won't have *C. gigas* MBD-Seq data for NSA, so I'll just focus on the reproductive physiology.
- Speaking of which...I finished the *C. gigas* [histology analyses](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Gonad-Histology-Update/)!
- I have (another) plan for the metaanalysis so I can work on something while I wait for sequencing data. I'm going to read and write my introduction first, then see if there's any data to analyze
- It wasn't an explicit goal, but I made my lab notebook more user friendly with [tags and comments](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Comments-and-Tags/)!

**February Goals**:

**DNR**:
- Get the DNR paper ready for submission
  - Address edits from Emma, Steven and Brent
  - Remake figures!
  - Send for another one-two rounds of feedback
- Compile a corresponding [DNR paper repository](https://github.com/RobertsLab/paper-gigas-DNR-proteomics)

**Manchester**:
- Assess statistical significance of differences in gonad histology, reproductive output, fertilization rates and larvae produced
- Analyze larval mortality data
- Start *C. gigas* RNA-Seq and MBD-Seq protocols

**Virginica**:
- Finish *C. virginica* MBD-Seq protocol

**Metaanalysis**:
- Read relevant papers
- Draft metaanalysis introduction

**Other**:
- Update [People page](http://faculty.washington.edu/sr320/?page_id=505) according to [previous feedback](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/19#issuecomment-321815817)
