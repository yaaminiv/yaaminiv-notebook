I had really lofty goals for August without realizing that I was going to be visiting family for a good chunk of the month (aka decreased productivity). I made some headway on things, but most of these goals will rollover to make a very packed September.

### [August Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/August-2022-Goals/)

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

- Completed initial TagSeq mapping but not differential expression analysis
- Haven't written methods or results

**Killifish Methylation and Expression**:

- I revisited the RNA-Seq results but did not get a chance to do anything else

**Virginica Methylation and Expression**:

- Lots of great discussions but no actual work was done

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- [Cleaned and analyzed the HOBO data to ensure my temperature treatments were significantly different!](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-Part13/)

**Other**:

- Started addressing reviewer comments on ocean acidification and reproduction review
- Checked in about eelgrass transcriptomics paper and confirmed I don't have any work to do with that paper
- Evaluated projects in deep freeze...they're oging to stay there a bit longer
- Found relevant faculty positions I will apply to this cycle

### September Goals

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

- Finalize differential expression analysis
- Complete gene enrichment analysis
- Update methods and results
- Outline discussion

**Killifish Methylation and Expression**:

- Test `BAT_DMRcorrelating` to match RRBS and RNA-Seq data
- Conduct pathway analysis for RNA-Seq data
- Investigate SNP associations with RRBS data
- Look into mQTL analysis
- Start RRBS mapping with new genome
- Update methods and results
- Put together draft EPIMAR talk

**Virginica Methylation and Expression**:

- Examine connections between transcript counts and methylation
- Determine which hypothesis-driven analyses from the workshop should be incorporated into the paper or redone based on gene expression results
- Finish transcriptional noise analysis
- Return to SPLS

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- Figure out which parts of the analysis Sara and Mikayla can work on
- Analyze survivorship data by treatment and sex
- Analyze time-to-right data by treatment, sex, weight, and integument color
- Update methods and results
- Determine workflow for respiration data analysis
- Determine workflow for metabolomics sample processing

**Faculty Applications**

- Sign up for academic jobs workshop
- Revise research statement
- Revise teaching statement
- Revise DEI statement
- Revise cover letter
- Update CV
- Submit applications due in September and early October

**Other**:

- Finish addressing reviewer comments on ocean acidification and reproduction review
- Distribute results of postdoctoral mentorship experiences survey
- Launch the postdoctoral mentoring program

### Deep Freeze

Things that are not immediate enough to be on the backburner, so they're stuck in the deep freeze.

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

I will revisit this paper after EPIMAR.

- Address Rajan's edits
- Return to `methylKit` for better interpretation
- Extract SNPs with `EpiDiverse` and create a relatedness matrix
- Look at methylation islands and non-methylated regions
- Examine overlaps between DML and other epigenomic datasets from Sascha

**Zebrafish DNMT**:

I'll think about this once I have a robust killifish paper draft.

- Identify a stress condition to use for the zebrafish based on disease factors or conditions that are known to induce changes in methylation
- Determine physiological endpoints to assess for embryos
- Construct a project timeline
