[Flowerball by The Wombats](https://open.spotify.com/track/7mviMqqbfFyZSE1F0pXV9o?si=e748db6550d947bb) really set the vibe for all of October. So here we are, November. Staring down the last two (but really 1.5) months of work for the year wondering where all the time went and what I've actually been doing.

### [October Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/September-2024-Goals/)

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- [Created a plan to integrate all analyses!](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-Part38/)
- [Correlated metabolomics and lipidomics WCNA!](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-Part39/)
- [Revised figures based on Carolyn's feedback](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-Part40/)

**NSF Grant**:

- Read (and re-read) an absurd amount of literature. So much so that I felt I was taking quals again.
- Revised project summary
- Determined that I should send a revised project summary to both IOS and ORCC (new deadline in January) to determine the best venue for the project

**Other**:

- Presented invited seminars at Bigelow and Colby College!
- Applied for relevant jobs

### November Goals

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- Finish -omics integration analysis
- Finish -omics and physiology integration analysis
- Repeated measures analysis without crab ID for TTR data
- Update methods
- Update results
- Write discussion
- Write introduction
- Write abstract

**NSF Grant**:

- Finalize project summary
- Send project summary to program officers and determine which program to submit to
- Present grant ideas to lab meeting
- Full grant draft
- Send materials to potential collaborators

**Cold Acclimation Green Crab Experiment**:

- Return to troubleshooting DNA extractions
- Return to troubleshooting triglyceride assay

**West Coast Green Crab Experiment**:

- Budget remaining NSF money
- Reorganize -80ºC so I can find all my samples
- Update summer notebook
- Identify samples for metabolomics and transcriptomics sequencing

**Other**:

- Apply for relevant jobs
- Publish RIE2 teaching module

### Deep Freeze

Things that are not immediate enough to be on the backburner, so they're stuck in the deep freeze.

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

These are things I need to do and can probably knock out in a week, but I think they're a lower priority right now for me since there's more momentum on other projects. At the very least, I need to reach out to collaborators and get this going again.

- Revise abstract
- Write discussion
- Write introduction

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

I'll return to this when the CEABiGR paper is published.

- Finish `methylKit` contingency tests
- Conduct a randomization test for DML identification
- Integrate other epigenetic datasets
- Update methods and results
- Revise discussion
