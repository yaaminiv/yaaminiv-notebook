## :cake: It's not as easy as pie :cake:

[PECAN](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/blob/master/protocols/DIA-data-Analyses.md) matches the peptides in [DNR samples](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Mass-Spec-Start/) to the peptides in the entire *C. gigas* proteome. It took me a few days to prepare the following inputs:

- Convert `.raw` files to `.mzML` files
- In Silico Tryptic Digest of *C. gigas* proteome and QC peptides
- Path files for converted `.mzML` files and background proteome
- Isolation window file

Because Laura's run of all her samples will take 12 days, we decided that it would be best for me to first run five oyster sample files. Then, I can proceed with analyzising them on Skyline and concurrently run other samples with PECAN.

I then ran `pecanpie` on Roadrunner. It worked! Here's a picture of it going:

And here's the [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-oyster-oa/blob/master/notebooks/DNR/2017-02-28-DIA-Analysis-PECAN.ipynb) detailing my work.
