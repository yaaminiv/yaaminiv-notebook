Last month I encountered more struggles with R and `methylKit` than I anticipated...and did you know that not having DML is a bottleneck when you're trying to understand methylation responses to ocean acidification?!??! Sigh. I made some progress that I think sets me up really well to finish my dissertation goals this month, so at least that's good!

### [April Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/April-2021-Goals/)

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

- [I extracted SNPs from bisulfite sequencing data with `BS-Snper`!](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Hawaii-Gigas-Methylation-Analysis-Part12/) I have SNPs for each individual oyster, as well as SNPs from a [merged BAM file](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Hawaii-Gigas-Methylation-Analysis-Part11/). I didn't get a chance to review SNP data or try `EpiDiverse/snp` just yet, but I have SNPs.
- I didn't work on getting DML from `methylKit` because I spent several weeks troubleshooting `methylKit` with the Manchester data. But, I have made progress on identifying a method!
- Decided not to get a [WGS resequencing quote](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/1124#event-4684675391) from Genewiz since we already have one from UW, and UW is likely cheaper!

**Gigas Gonad Methylation**:

- [Extracted SNPs with `BS-Snper`!](https://yaaminiv.github.io/WGBS-Analysis-Part17/)
- Embarked on a **_SAGA_** to identify DML using `methylKit`, which included [testing the base code](https://yaaminiv.github.io/WGBS-Analysis-Part18/), [separating female and indeterminate samples](https://yaaminiv.github.io/WGBS-Analysis-Part19/), [preparing a `mox` script](https://yaaminiv.github.io/WGBS-Analysis-Part20/), [running R on `mox` in a SLURM script](https://yaaminiv.github.io/WGBS-Analysis-Part21/), [calling an R script from a SLURM script](https://yaaminiv.github.io/WGBS-Analysis-Part22/), and finally, [using the R Studio server](https://yaaminiv.github.io/WGBS-Analysis-Part23/). Now I have DML and a workflow!

**Other**:

- I paused work on the ocean acidification and reproduction review

### May Goals

AKA rolling over April Goals that were rolled over from March
