## Checking in before we leave for NSA

Laura and I did the following today:

- Water chemistry sampling: 1L grab samples and bottle samples
- Drain and clean tanks with Vortexx
   - We started seeing some unknown stringy stuff in our tanks, so we thought it would be best to drain and clean oysters weekly. Laura took a picture of it, and Ryan agreed to show it to someone who may be able to identify what it is. Ryan's never seen this in Olys before, so it's likely *C. gigas* influencing this.
- Rinsed oysters with freshwater
- Cleaned filters
- Bleached algal lines

Everything went smoothly, so we'll all set for Grace and Olivia to take over next week!
