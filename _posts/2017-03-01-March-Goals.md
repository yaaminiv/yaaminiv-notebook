## March Maddness is upon us

It's the month of NSA! For this reason, my priorities will shift towards conference preparation. I'm also going to add in dates for myself so I space out my progress (does this mean I'm getting better at realistic goal-setting??).

#### NSA Preparation 
- PECAN Analysis
 - All of my computer issues are resolved, so I can prepare all of the inputs and run PECAN. I may have to modify my run, since it's taking Laura 12 full days to finish running all of her samples and blanks.
- Skyline Analysis
  - I hope I can start on some of this before I leave town on March 14.
