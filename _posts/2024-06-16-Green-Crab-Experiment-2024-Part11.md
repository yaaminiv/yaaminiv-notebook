## Experiment log: Acclimation week

### 2024-06-16

- Came back from a week away! Catlin and Heidi did an amazing job taking care of the crabs and keeping notes in the binder
- Noticed that the rack lights were not on when I walked in. I gave them a little tap and they sprang back
- Crab 33 in Tank 2 dead

**Figures 1-2**. Room without rack lights on

### 2024-06-17

- T5-T7 filters and air stones were off, so several crabs were clinging onto the mesh at the top of the tank. I must not have turned them back on after cleaning
- T7 had eggs in the tank, likely from crab 118
- Ammonia check
- Replaced 60% of water
- Added ammonia conditioner to all tanks
- Fed crabs
- No mortalities!
- Catlin and Heidi rearranged the experimental tanks so they were all on the same level under a rack light. They also moved cords to racks away from the tanks and covered the extension cords with trash bags so they wouldn't get wet.

### 2024-06-18

- T1-T3 air stones and filters were off. Catlin and Heidi must have forgotten to turn them back on after rearranging the cords
- Took HOBO data for tank temperatures
  - I noticed that T5-7 were averaging ~ 17ºC, with big swings between 16ºC and ~18.5ºC during the day. T1-3, however, stayed constant at 16ºC. First, this is a good sign that my cold tanks are in the right place! I also expect the temperature fluctuations to not be an issue once the room is colder and heaters are in. However, I did lower the temperature of the room to 13.5ºC to try and get tank averages closer to 14 or 15ºC. I'll check HOBOs again on Thursday and if needed, lower the temperature further.

- Cleaned tanks
- Fed crabs
  - Brought in my 1/4 tsp for feeding!
- Updated all online spreadsheets

### 2024-06-19

- Cleaned tanks
- Crab 107 dead in T6
- Replaced nitrogen filters
- Fed crabs
- *FINALLY* created a [Github repository](https://github.com/yaaminiv/cold-green-crab) for this project

### Going forward

1. Obtain and label more MA crabs
2. Genotype MA crabs
3. Develop heart rate protocol
