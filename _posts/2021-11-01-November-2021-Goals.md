### [October Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/October-2021-Goals/)

**Gigas Gonad Methylation**:

- Examined [genes with enriched GOterms](https://yaaminiv.github.io/WGBS-Analysis-Part34/), [identified gene functions](https://yaaminiv.github.io/WGBS-Analysis-Part35/), and [potential GOterm nesting and DML direction](https://yaaminiv.github.io/WGBS-Analysis-Part36/)
- Updated methods and results!
- Started reworking discussion with gene functions and direct comparisons to other studies, but have not finished yet

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

- Cleaned up any remaining comments and sent a draft to Maria and Rajan. And that's about it.

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

- Reviewed Maggie's extraction protocol and previous work and started drafting hypotheses to test

**Other**:

- Completed onboarding!
- Determined goals and potential projects for postdoc
- Drafted NSF PRFB
- Identified additional papers for ocean acidification and reproduction review
- Completed review for Scientific Data!
