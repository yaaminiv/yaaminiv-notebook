## Treatment Days 5 through 7

### Day 5

- Fixed T6 temperature
  - Added tank to the right side of T6 to insulate it from the 15ºC line. Checked after 15 minutes and temperature increased from 21.6ºC to 22.3ºC
  - + 30 min: 22.3ºC to 22.9ºC
  - + 30 more min: no increase
  - Probes for front heaters swapped between T3 and T6!
    - T3 heater tried heating T6, but the temperature in T3 did not increase because the back heater was modulating temperature
    - Put proper probe in proper tank and labelled probes, heaters, and controllers with tank numbers
    - Back heaters in correct tanks, so just a front heater tissue
  - Confirmed T6 reached the proper temperature
- Checked ammonia. Added 1/2 tsp conditioner when ammonia > 1.0
  - T1: 1.0
  - T2: 0.25
  - T3: 8.0
  - T4: 4.0
  - T5: 0.25
  - T6: 1.0
- Clean tanks and performed water change for all
- No mortality in any tanks
- Feed crabs
  - Debris in T2, T3, and T5
  - T1 and T4: 1/4 tsp
  - T2 and T5: 1/4 tsp
  - T3 and T6: 3/8-ish tsp
- Airstone disconnected in T6, reattached

### Day 6

- Checked ammonia. Added 1/2 tsp conditioner when ammonia ≥ 1.0
  - T1: 1.0
  - T2: 0.25
  - T3: 8.0
  - T4: 4.0
  - T5: 0.25
  - T6: 4.0
- Clean tanks and performed water change only for T3 and T6
- No mortality in any tanks
- Feed crabs
  - Debris in T2, T3, and T5
  - T1 and T4: 1/4 tsp
  - T2 and T5: 1/8 tsp
  - T3 and T6: 1/4 tsp
- T3 and T6: crabs hanging out on top of tank

### Day 7

- Checked ammonia. Added 1/2 tsp conditioner when ammonia ≥ 1.0
  - T1: 0.25
  - T2: 0
  - T3: 8.0
  - T4: 2.0
  - T5: 0
  - T6: 4.0
- Clean tanks and performed water change only for T3 and T6. Removed any and all debris to starve crabs prior to respirometry
  - T2 and T5: less debris than before, but food debris still on the bottom of the tank
  - T3 and T6: food debris under heater and air stones
- No mortality in any tanks
- T3: 4 crabs on top
- T6: 2 crabs on top

### Going forward

1. Continue with experiment
2. Ask why warm tanks have consistently high ammonia
2. Update protocols
3. Create mortality spreadsheet
3. Organize project repository and datasheets
