## MBD-Biotin wash and binding (again) and ethanol precipitations

Similar to [last week](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Sperm-DNA-MBD-Enrichment-Day7/), I started the DNA and MBD-Biotin binding process with my five remaining samples (9, 48, 57, 59, and 63). These samples all required different input volumes since they did not have at least 4 µg of DNA, so I had to go even slower and refer to [my spreadsheet](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-oyster-comparative-omics/blob/master/metadata/Virginica-MBDSeq-Labwork-Calculations.xlsx) with reagent volumes. Before I started, I prepared 10 mL of 1X Bind/Wash Buffer with 2 mL of 5X Bind/Wash Buffer and 8 mL of DNAse-free water.

### Step 1: Prepare beads

- Labelled ten 1.7 mL centrifuge tubes with sample number and "B" (ex. 9 B)
- Obtained Dynabead stock from 4ºC fridge
- Resuspended beads by gently pipetting up and down (slow and only to the first stop)
- Added 10 µL of beads for each µg of DNA to each centrifuge tube
- Brought volume in tube up to 100 µL with 1x Bind/Wash Buffer, and gently mixed tube contents by pipetting
- For each tube (one tube at a time):
  - Placed tubes on a magnetic rack for 1 minute to concentrate beads
  - Kept tube in rack and removed supernatant. It's important to not touch the beads in this step!
  - Immediately removed tube in the rack and added 100 µL of 1X Bind/Wash Buffer to resuspend beads. The beads cannot be left dry for more than a minute. 
  - Repeated this procedure once more for a total of two times.

### Step 2: Bind MBD-Biotin protein

- Labelled ten 1.7 mL centrifuge tubes with sample number and "P" (ex. 9 P)
- Obtained MBD-Biotin Protein from -80ºC freezer (rack 12, column 3, row 2)
- For each µg of input DNA, I added 7 µL of MBD-Biotin Protein
- Topped off volume to 200 µL with 1X Bind/Wash Buffer, gently pipetting to mix
- Transfered MBD-Biotin protein tube contents to corresponding "B" tube
- Placed all "B" tubes on a rotating mixer for one hour at room temperature
  - Start: 10:30 a.m., end: 11:30 a.m. (perfectly timed with lab meeting #efficiency)

### Step 3: Wash MBD and beads

- For each tube:
  - Placed tubes on a magnetic rack for 1 minute to concentrate beads
  - Kept tube in rack and removed supernatant. It's important to not touch the beads in this step!
  - Immediately removed tube in the rack and added 100 µL of 1X Bind/Wash Buffer to resuspend beads. The beads cannot be left dry for more than a minute.
  - Placed tubes back in rotating mixer for 5 minutes at room temperature
  - Repeated this procedure twice more for a total of three times.
- For each tube:
  - Placed tubes on a magnetic rack for 1 minute to concentrate beads
  - Kept tube in rack and removed supernatant. It's important to not touch the beads in this step!
  - Immediately removed tube in the rack and added 100 µL of 1X Bind/Wash Buffer to resuspend beads. The beads cannot be left dry for more than a minute. 

### Step 4: Add DNA

- Set up rotating mixer in the 4ºC fridge in FTR 213
- Obtained 5X Bind/Wash Buffer
- Diluted samples to 25 ng/µL with DNAse-free water
  - Sample 7 needed to be diluted with ~1700 µL of water so I needed to transfer the sample from the small shearing tube to a 2 mL centrifuge tube
- Labelled ten 1.7 mL centrifuge tubes with sample number and "DNA" (ex. 9 DNA)
- Added 100 µL of **5X Bind/Wash Buffer** to each tube
  - Didn't mess it up this time!
- Added designated sample DNA volume from calcuations to each "DNA" tube
  - Used all of samples 6 and 12
- Topped "DNA" tube volumes to 500 µL with DNAse-free water
- Transfered "DNA" tube contents to corresponding "B" tubes
- Mixed tubes on a rotating mixer overnight at 4ºC
  - Placed the tubes in the mixer at 12:40 p.m.

After I added Batch 2 samples to the rotating mixer, I decided to finish the ethanol precipitation!

### Step 0: Prepare for precipitations

- Set up centrifuge in the 4ºC frige in FTR 213
- Obtained samples from the -20ºC freezer in FTR 209 and placed them in the 4ºC fridge in FTR 213
- Made 70% EtOH with 7 mL 100% ethanol and 3 mL DNAse free water and placed it in the -20ºC freezer in FTR 209
- Labelled tubes to save ethanol precipitation supernatant
  - sample number and "E1 Sup" (ex. 6 E1 Sup)
  - sample number and "E2 Sup" (ex. 6 E2 Sup)
  - sample number and "E3 Sup" (ex. 6 E3 Sup)
  - sample number and "EtOH Sup" (ex. 6 EtOH Sup)

### Step 1: Pellet DNA and consolidate

While I could pellet each E1, E2, and E3 tube separately and consolidate after resuspension, this allows me to increase my final DNA concentration and not work with so many tubes.

- For each "E1" tube
  - Centrifuged tubes for 15 minutes at 16,000 rcf at 4ºC
  - Pipetted supernatant from "E1" tube into corresponding "E1 Sup" tube without disturbing the pellet
  - Added "E2" tube contents into corresonding "E1" tube
- For each "E1" tube with "E2" supernatant
  - Centrifuged tubes for 15 minutes at 16,000 rcf at 4ºC
  - Pipetted supernatant from "E1" tube into corresponding "E2 Sup" tube without disturbing the pellet
  - Added "E3" tube contents into corresonding "E1" tube
- For each "E1" tube with "E3" supernatant
  - Centrifuged tubes for 15 minutes at 16,000 rcf at 4ºC
  - Pipetted supernatant from "E1" tube into corresponding "E3 Sup" tube without disturbing the pellet
  
### Step 2: Ethanol precipitation

- Obtain 70% EtOH and place on ice
- For each "E1 tube"
  - Added 500 µL 70% ice cold EtOH into "E1" tubes
  - Centrifuged tubes for 5 minutes at 16,000 rcf at 4ºC
  - Pipetted supernatant from "E1" tube into corresponding "EtOH Sup" tube without disturbing the pellet
  - Repeated this entire process once more for a total of two times
- Air-dried the pellet fro 5 minutes
  - I avoided drying out the pellet fully as instructed by the protocol
- Resuspended DNA pellet with 25 µL Qiagen Buffer EB ([method copied from Sam's notebook](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2018/02/07/ethanol-precipitation-dna-quantification-c-virginica-mbd-dna-from-yaamini.html)) and placed samples in the -20ºC freezer in FTR 209

### Going forward

1. Label six sets of 1.7 mL centrifuge tubes for non-captured DNA, washes, and elutions
2. Complete elutions and ethanol precipitations
