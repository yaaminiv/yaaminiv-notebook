## Final shearing and quality checks

I need to confirm samples 6, 48, and 63 are good to go before I can do MBD enrichment. I made 1:100 dilutions using 1 µL of each sample and 99 µL of DNAse free water, vortexed them to mix, and ran them on the BioAnalyzer with [some *C. gigas* samples]().

Looking at the electropherograms, 6 may need to be sheared more and 63 should be good to go. The peak is a little lower than I would have liked it to be, but I also vortexed my diluted sample before loading it onto the BioAnalyzer, which could have fragmented the DNA. The electropherogram for 48 doesn't show any DNA! I added an additonal 1 µL of DNA to my 1:100 dilution, making it a 1:50 dilution. I sheared sample 6 for 2 more cycles (30 seconds on, 30 seconds off) at 4 ºC. I then made a 1:100 dilution and ran another BioAnalyzer chip.

**Figure 6-7**. Bionanalyzer results for 6 and 48.

Sample 6 looked good, but I still had barely any DNA in 48! I looked in my notes and realized I [previously used a 1:20 dilution for sample 48](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Sperm-DNA-MBD-Enrichment-Day4/). I made a 1:20 dilution and ran the sample.

All my samples are now sufficiently sheared! I'll start MBD enrichment tomorrow.

### Going forward

2. Dilute samples to 25 ng/µL
3. Prepare reagents for MethylMiner kit (1X Buffer) and label tubes
4. Process *C. virginica* sperm samples in two batches with MethylMiner kit
5. Complete ethanol precipitation with all *C. virginica* sperm samples
