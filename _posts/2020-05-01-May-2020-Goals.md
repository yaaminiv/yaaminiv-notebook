Now that I can't get into the lab, I'm transitioning over to writing and analysis work! Here's what I think I can accomplish this month on top of surviving a pandemic.

### **[April Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/April-2020-Goals/)**:

**Virginica Gonad Methylation**:

- [Paper is now published](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2020.00225)!
- Submitted press release request to Dan DiNicola
- Did not destrand data for Katie but it doesn't seem urgent

**Gigas and Virginica Labwork**:

- Catalogued all samples that could be used for future projects
- Looked into ATAC-Seq methods
- Started looking into labwork and sequencing kits and costs for various assays

**Coral Methylation Comparison**:

- [Finalized genome feature tracks for both species based on what was in the associated GFFs](https://yaaminiv.github.io/MethCompare-Part3/)
- [Reran CpG characterization pipeline with full samples and genome feature tracks](https://yaaminiv.github.io/MethCompare-Part8/)
- Worked on [obtaining checksums](https://yaaminiv.github.io/MethCompare-Part6/), [checking various pipelines](https://yaaminiv.github.io/MethCompare-Part7/), and [generating summary tables and figures](https://yaaminiv.github.io/MethCompare-Part9/)

**Other**:

- Helped out with FISH 441/541 class
- Updated Ph.D proposal with lumped chapter for *C. gigas* and *C. virginica* adult and larvae methylation analysis
- Figured out the next steps for SAFS milestones
- Update CV, Google Scholar, and ORCID profiles
- Didn't go through my "papers to read" folder, but hellped with Environmental Physiology Reading Group

### **May Goals**

**Coral Methylation Comparison**:

- Create flanking track and locate RepeatMasker transposable element tracks for each genome
- Create figures and conduct statistical analysis for CpG distributions in both species
- Update methods and results of paper
- Work on any other stuff we talk about at our weekly meetings

**Gigas and Virginica Labwork**:

- Work on sequencing and analysis plan for *C. virginica* that maps back to NSF grant requirements
- Figure out ATAC-Seq can match samples used for *C. virginica* grant
- Work on sequencing and analysis plan for *C. gigas* adults and larvae

**Other**:

- Schedule general exam
- Update Ph.D proposal with more concrete information for *C. gigas* and *C. virginica* methylation inheritance information, and with information on ATAC-Seq methods
