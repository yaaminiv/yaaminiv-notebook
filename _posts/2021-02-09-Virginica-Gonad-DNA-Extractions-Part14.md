## Sending samples for sequencing

Then there's nothing left to do but send out the samples! I labelled screw top tubes for all samples with enough DNA and RNA yield based on [the extraction metadata](). Basically, this meant I labelled DNA and RNA tubes for every sample except for sample 57. I used screw top tubes because they're more secure and I didn't want any samples spilling! Once tubes were labelled, I grabbed the samples from the -80 ÂºC and let them equilibrate to room temperature. I centrifuged each sample to ensure all the liquid could easily be pipetted, and transferred it to the appropriate labelled screw top tube. I then put that tube in a labelled ziploc bag, using separate ones for DNA and RNA. I placed the filled ziploc bags with samples at the bottom of a cooler with an insulating lining. I then filled the lining with dry ice so there was ample ice to keep the samples cold. Once the samples were packaged properly, I sent the package to ZymoResearch via [FedEx Overnight](https://www.fedex.com/fedextrack/?trknbr=9182%206479%200776&trkqual=2459255000~918264790776~FX)!

### Going forward

1. Wait for sequencing data!
