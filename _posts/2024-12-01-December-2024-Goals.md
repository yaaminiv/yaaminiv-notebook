I truly don't know what happened last month. It was just a weird haze with long lab days? Let's see if this fake month between various holidays actually proves fruitful.

I have low expectations.

### [November Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/November-2024-Goals/)

**Cold Acclimation Green Crab Experiment**:

- [Did some genotyping troubleshooting](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2024-Part23/)
- [FINISHED TROUBLESHOOTING](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2024-Part24/)
- [Continued genotyping MA crabs](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2024-Part25/)

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- [Ran supplementary lipidomics analyses](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-Part41/)

**NSF Grant**:

- Continued revising project summary

**Other**:

- Applied for relevant jobs
- [Published RIE2 teaching module](https://qubeshub.org/publications/5036/)!

### December Goals

**Cold Acclimation Green Crab Experiment**:

- Finish genotyping MA crabs
- Genotype WA crabs that were alive for the whole experiment
- Genotype remaining WA crabs
- Incorporate genotype into MA TTR analysis
- Incorporate genotype into WA TTR analysis

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- Finish -omics integration analysis
- Finish -omics and physiology integration analysis
- Repeated measures analysis without crab ID for TTR data
- Update methods
- Update results
- Write discussion
- Write introduction
- Write abstract

**NSF Grant**:

- Finalize project summary
- Send project summary to program officers and determine which program to submit to
- Present grant ideas to lab meeting
- Full grant draft
- Send materials to potential collaborators

**West Coast Green Crab Experiment**:

- Budget remaining NSF money
- Reorganize -80ÂºC so I can find all my samples
- Update summer notebook
- Identify samples for metabolomics and transcriptomics sequencing

**Other**:

- Put together SICB talk
- Apply for relevant jobs

### Deep Freeze

Things that are not immediate enough to be on the backburner, so they're stuck in the deep freeze.

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

These are things I need to do and can probably knock out in a week, but I think they're a lower priority right now for me since there's more momentum on other projects. At the very least, I need to reach out to collaborators and get this going again.

- Revise abstract
- Write discussion
- Write introduction

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

I'll return to this when the CEABiGR paper is published.

- Finish `methylKit` contingency tests
- Conduct a randomization test for DML identification
- Integrate other epigenetic datasets
- Update methods and results
- Revise discussion
