No no small child, don't worry. There is a spring break. And I'm even going on vacation! However, this means that I only have 19 days to finish up all of my March goals :0 But first, let's review last month's progress.

### [February Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/February-2019-Goals/):

**Bypass**:

- Submitted my bypass application...AND GOT MY BYPASS APPROVED! That's right. I'm a Ph.D student now :0

**Virginica**:

- [I did a gene enrichment](https://yaaminiv.github.io/DML-Analysis-Part22/)! Wasn't really useful.
- I described gene products for [DMR-mRNA](https://yaaminiv.github.io/DML-Analysis-Part23/) and [DML-mRNA](https://yaaminiv.github.io/DML-Analysis-Part25/) overlaps.
- Since I'm still working on analyses, I haven't figured out a story to write about in my next paper.
- I also [started isolating DNA from sperm samples](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Sperm-DNA-Extractions/) from the Lotterhos Lab's 2018 experiment.

**Gigas Broodstock**:

- Didn't send samples for sequencing or determine if I can isolate RNA, but I did make a [nifty flowchart](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oE2c7QZGSeQ73HLsZw0hJBmLwODXwiVWfhYlJbzetMg/edit).

### March Goals

**Virginica**:

- Finish gene product descriptions
- Compare hypermethylated and hypomethylated DMRs and DMLs
- Draft discussion
- Finish sperm DNA extractions and send samples for whole genome bisulfite sequencing

**Gigas Broodstock**:

- Figure out what to do with the isolated DNA...and do it.

**Other**:

- Add new members to my committee
- Schedule a committee meeting
- Figure out when I'm taking my written exam
- Polish my Ph.D proposal
