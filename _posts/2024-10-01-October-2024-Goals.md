I had a very ambitious plan for September! Instead, I kinda treaded water and recharged while on vacation. Much like Moo Deng, my motivation was not present for anything that involved work. Perhaps there's now a fire lit under me that will keep me going?

### [September Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/September-2024-Goals/)

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- [Finalized lipidomics analysis](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-Part32/) and [WCNA](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-Part33/)!
- [Finalized metabolomics enrichment analysis](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-Part36/)!
- [Finalized lipidomics enrichment analysis](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-Part35/)!
- [Dug into enrichment results](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-Part37/)!

**West Coast Green Crab Experiment**:

- [Revised analytical methods for TTR and respirometry](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2023-Part57/)!

**Killifish Methylation and Expression**:

- Updated methods and results

**Job Applications**:

- Created job application schedule
- Updated job application materials
- Applied for relevant jobs

**Other**:

- Worked on invited seminars for Bigelow and Colby College
- CEABiGR paper was accepted for publication!

### October Goals

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- Repeated measures analysis without crab ID for TTR data
- Determine if physiology data can be integrated with -omics data
- Determine if metabolomics and lipidomics data can be integrated
- Update methods
- Update results
- Write discussion
- Write introduction
- Write abstract

**NSF ORCC**:

- Reread relevant literature
- Finalize project summary
- Full grant draft
- Send materials to collaborators

**West Coast Green Crab Experiment**:

- Reorganize -80ÂºC so I can find all my samples
- Update summer notebook
- Identify samples for metabolomics and transcriptomics sequencing

**Cold Acclimation Green Crab Experiment**:

- Return to troubleshooting DNA extractions
- Return to troubleshooting triglyceride assay

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

These are things I need to do and can probably knock out in a week, but I think they're a lower priority right now for me since there's more momentum on other projects. At the very least, I need to reach out to collaborators and get this going again.

- Revise abstract
- Write discussion
- Write introduction

**Other**:

- Present invited seminars at Bigelow and Colby College
- Apply for relevant jobs

### Deep Freeze

Things that are not immediate enough to be on the backburner, so they're stuck in the deep freeze.

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

I'll return to this when the CEABiGR paper is published.

- Finish `methylKit` contingency tests
- Conduct a randomization test for DML identification
- Integrate other epigenetic datasets
- Update methods and results
- Revise discussion
