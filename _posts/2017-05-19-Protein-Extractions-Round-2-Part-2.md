title: Protein Extractions Round 2: Part 2
---

## More cowbell? More samples.

I started thinking about my next round of protein extractions [a few weeks ago](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Protein-Extractions-Round-2/), but now I have a better plan. I'm going to focus solely on the first outplant. I also noticed that the second ouptlant Case Inlet organisms had the lowest sample size. There were only five in the bare treatment, and one in the eelgrass treatment. For this reason, using only the first outplant would give me a larger sample size and allow me to understand the differences between all sites and eelgrass conditions.

I'm going to extract proteins in two blocks of 25 samples each:

**Table 1**. Proteins to extract. The bolded samples are those I will extract in the first block.
