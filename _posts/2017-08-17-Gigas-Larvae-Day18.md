## The end.

As I predicted, all of my treatment groups had no more than 10,000 larvae still alive! I screened and counted all larvae on 80 and 60 micron screens, then collected all remaining larvae. I kept each bucket and screen size separate for this sampling round. My counts can be found [here](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-oyster-oa/blob/master/data/Manchester/2017-07-30-Pacific-Oyster-Larvae/2017-08-02-Larvae-Counts.xlsx), and I created a chart of the number of live larvae per treatment over time.

Grace and I then cleaned all of the buckets and totes, disassembled the heaters, packed away tripours, bleached and cleaned the large header tank, and cleaned the SeaLab space. Looks like this segment of my work is done!

P.S. I came back on Sunday to download [HOBO data](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-oyster-oa/tree/master/data/Manchester/2017-07-30-Pacific-Oyster-Larvae/HOBO-Data) and clean some more.
