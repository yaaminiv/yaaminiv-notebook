## Treatment Days 27-31

I was gone this week at the WOCinEEB Networks of Success Conference! All of these notes came from Sarah Z.

  - T2: 8.0
  - T3: 8.0
  - T4: 0.25
  - T5: 8.0
  - T6: 8.0
  - T7: 2.0
  - T8: 8.0

**7/26/23**:

- TTR and respirometry for 5ºC and 25ºC tanks
  - Dumped background water for probe 4 when setting up probes 2 and 3 backgrounds. Ran for 15 minutes before being dumped. Probes 2 and 3 ran normally but forgot to stop recording before disassembly so there's noise at the end of the file
- Salinities
  - T1: 40
  - T3: 34
  - T4: 49
  - T6: 36
  - T7: 38
  - T9: 34
- 25-176 actively molting in T9 during TTR. Put in freezer since it would die after molting anyways.

  - T2: 9
  - T3: 9
  - T4: 10
  - T5: 8
  - T6: 7
  - T7: 8
  - T8: 8

  - T12: 10
- T5, T6, T8 airstones and all filters not working for 15ºC and 25ºC tanks. Replaced powerstrip before realizing theat issue was with the outlet for the extension cord. Reset outlet and everything worked again.

**7/27/23**:

- TTR and respirometry for 15ºC tanks
- Salinities
  - T2: 35
  - T5: 34
  - T8: 34

  - T11: 10
  - T12: 10
- Moved Julia's crabs from 10ºC to 15ºC

**7/28/23**:

- Ammonia testing and 60% of water replaced in all tanks. Conditioner added when ammonia > 1.0
  - T1: 0.25
  - T2: 4.0

  - T1: 9
  - T2: 9
  - T3: 9
  - T4: 10
  - T5: 8
  - T6: 6
  - T7: 8
  - T8: 8
  - T9: 6
  - T10: 12
  - T11: 10
  - T12: 10
- I asked Sarah to double feed because I knew I wouldn't be back until late on Sunday. Given that there were water changes yesterday and filter replacements today, I felt confident that things would be okay if I only checked on them on Monday.

### Going forward

1. Continue doing daily checks and with experimental time points
2. Assist Lauren and Julia with experiments
2. Test formatting and analysis for one set of respirometry data
7. Respirometry analysis
8. Update methods
9. Update results
