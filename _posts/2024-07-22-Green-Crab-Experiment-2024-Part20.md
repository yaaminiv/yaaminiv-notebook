### 2024-07-22

- Time-to-right for all non-heart rate crabs
- Sampled crabs
- Tried to do heart rate at 0 hours
  - I was able to set up the computer yesterday and I could collect good looking data........but the backpacks were a PAIN
  - Multiple crabs I epoxied the backpacks onto yesterday had already lost their backpacks. I decided to start with crabs from T5 and T6, since the crabs from those tanks had their backpacks. When I tried to screw them onto the probes, some of them lost their backpacks!! Even at the ambient temperature, the epoxy was too brittle.
  - After a few rounds of trying and failing and re-epoxying, I decided to call it quits for heart rate for this experiment. We had been working for 3 hours and had only finished two tanks of TTR and one of the four heart rate rounds! If the epoxy was brittle now, it was only going to get worse. Bummer, because it would have been really cool data.
- Repeated analysis for 4 hour timepoint

### 2024-07-23

- Time-to-right for all non-heart rate crabs
- Sampled crabs
- Timepoints at 8 a.m. and 2 p.m.
- FINALLY pulled my HOBO data (whoops)
  - Battery reset, but was able to get data and relaunch: T1B and T2A
  - Low battery: T7A
  - Dead, calibrated a replacement: T5A, T5B, T8B
  - T8A was reading around 4.8/4.9ºC, so I bumped up the set point from 5ºC to 5.2ºC
  - Interestingly, my 0ºC tanks were reading closer to 2ºC than the MA crab tanks. I wonder if this is just because I have more tanks so there's additional humidity and insulation. I lowered the room setpoint from 0ºC to -0.2ºC

### 2024-07-24

- Time-to-right for all non-heart rate crabs
- Sampled crabs
  - Instead of only sampling TTR crabs for this timepoint, I sampled some HR crabs. This way, I could get samples for molecular analyses while maintaining a higher sample size for the final TTR measurements on Friday
- Timepoint at 8 a.m.
- Checked HOBO data
  - Dead, calibrated a replacement: T1B and T2A
  - Tanks were reading closer to 1.5ºC! I wanted them a bit lower to match the MA data, so I changed the room setpoint to -0.5ºC

### 2024-07-25

- Checked for mortalities and there were none

### 2024-07-26

- Time-to-right for all remaining crabs
- Sampled crabs
- Timepoint at 8 a.m.
- Checked HOBO data
  - Seems like there was diurnal variation in temperature. Closer to 1.5ºC in the night when the lights were off, but 2.0ºC when the lights were on. Oh well, I guess that's the experimental value for the treatment!
  - T5B-2 died. Le sigh. This is why we have two loggers per tank.
- Cleaned EVERYTHING for the experiment and the cold room
