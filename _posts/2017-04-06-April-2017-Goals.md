#### [March Goals](https://yaaminiv.github.io/March-2017-Goals/) Recap

NSA went well! I'm happy with [my poster](https://yaaminiv.github.io/NSA-Poster/), and I learned a lot about the field and hashed out some future directions for my projects. It was also really flattering that people thought I was a late-career Ph.D student (I'm not sure if they thought I just looked old or if my work was at that level, but I'd like to think it was the latter). I still haven't touched either Pubathon paper in a while, nor have I thought about future experiments. But hey, that's what monthly goals are for, right?

#### April Goals

This month, I want to focus on my metaanalysis since I was so absorbed in the DNR project last quarter. I also need to think critically about the questions I want to address with the Manchester experiment.

DNR Paper:
- Update methods: April 10
- Introduction: April 20

Other:
- Committee Ideas: When I met with Steven this week, we decided to think about the committee more in the summer. However, I now think it may be best for me to establish my committee this quarter so I can use my time over the summer to develop my proposal and have my committee provide feedback.
