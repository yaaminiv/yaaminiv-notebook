I can't believe I start my **_FIFTH YEAR_** of graduate school later this month!! My attempt to be productive this summer before starting this milestone has been relatively fruitful but also...most days I'm Toad.

### **[August Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/August-2020-Goals/)**:

**Coral Methylation Comparison**:

- Updated the manuscript so it was ready for others to look at

**Virginica Sperm Labwork**:

- [Finished shearing and quality checking samples](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Sperm-DNA-MBD-Enrichment-Day6/)
- Performed MBD enrichment in two batches ([batch 1](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Sperm-MBD-Enrichment-Day9/), [batch 2](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Sperm-MBD-Enrichment-Day11/))

**Gigas Gonad Labwork**:

- [Finished checking DNA quality](https://yaaminiv.github.io/WGBS-Samples-Part5/)
- [Conduct ethanol precipitations for DNA that did not go well](https://yaaminiv.github.io/WGBS-Samples-Part6/), but had salvagable results
- [Checked sample quality after ethanol precipitations](https://yaaminiv.github.io/WGBS-Samples-Part7/)
- Sent DNA for sequencing! Which got prompty returned back...so I sent it out again.
- Looked into RNA isolation protocol and materials

**Other**:

- Finished *Z. marina* analyses
- Drafted full ocean acidification and reproduction review
- Reviewed manuscript for Ecological Applications
- Identified a few postdoc opportunities, but didn't finish reviewing all options or creating a timeline for postdoc funding applications due to an inconvenient existential crisis

### **September Goals**

**Virginica Labwork**:

- [Identify supplies needed for female MBD](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/995#event-3696117167)
- Perform MBD enrichment
- Create outline for *C. virginica* heredity paper
- Send male and female samples for sequencing

**Gigas Gonad Labwork**:

- Order materials for RNA isolation, if needed
- Test RNA extraction protocol
- Extract RNA from histology samples sent for WGBS
- Send RNA for sequencing

**ATAC-Seq Labwork**:

- Identify supplies needed and order
- Determine which samples should be used for testing

**Coral Methylation Comparison**:

- Address suggestions and comments

**Other**:

- Finalize ocean acidification and reproduction review for friendly reviewers
- Create WGCNA and GO-MWU figures fro *Z. marina* analyses
- Finalize postdoc position options and start applying
