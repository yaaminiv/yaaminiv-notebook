## Speed Vacuum = Slow Process

In the morning we grabbed our samples that were incubating overnight and headed straight over to the Genome Sciences building to use their speed vacuum. Unfortunately, we had to wait 5 hours before we could use it :sob:

#### **Protocol**:
- Obtain samples in snaptop centrifuge tubes incubating overnight
 - If you need to wait for the speed vacuum, place samples in wet ice
- Load samples into speed vacuum. Ensure samples are balanced.
 - Make: CentriVap (R) Refrigerated Centrifugal Concentrators
 - Model: 7310021
 - Temperature: 4ºC
 - Refrigeration: Yes
 - Goal: Want approximately 20 µL of liquid left in snaptop centrifuge tubes
  
We loaded our samples at 2 p.m. It takes approximately 10 hours for samples to reach desired volume with our settings.

**Figure 1**. Me using laser to check the samples in the speed vacuum.

**Figure 2**. What it looks like when you check samples in the speed vacuum! The laser emits light at the same frequency that the centrifuge rotates at. Pretty neat stuff.

**Table 1**. Times we removed samples from the speed vacuum. We stored samples in the -80ºC freezer immediately after removal.
