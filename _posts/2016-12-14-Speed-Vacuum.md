title: Speed Vacuum

## Speed Vacuum = Slow Process

Today we grabbed our samples that were incubating overnight and headed straight over to the Genome Sciences building to use their speed vacuum. Unfortunately, we had to wait 5 hours before we could use it :sob:

#### **Protocol**:
- Obtain samples in snaptop centrifuge tubes incubating overnight
 - If you need to wait for the speed vacuum, place samples in wet ice
- Load samples into speed vacuum
  - Model: 
  - Temperature: 4ºC
  - Goal: Want approximately 20 µL of liquid left in snaptop centrifuge tubes
  
We loaded our samples at 2 p.m. It takes approximately 10 hours for samples to reach desired volume with our settings. We removed the samples at [[insert time here]] and stored them in the -80ºC.
