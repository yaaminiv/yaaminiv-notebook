## The Lab Notebook of Yaamini R. Venkataraman, a graduate student in the Roberts Lab at the University of Washington, Seattle.

*The short version:*

I'm primarily interested in how climate change is going to affect the organisms in our current and future oceans. I currently study how ocean acidification affects oysters using "-omic" techniques. I'm also interested in projects at the intersection of science, policy and communication!

*The long version:*

As a California Bay Area native, I grew up going to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. I was always floored by the intricacies of the organisms themselves, but also how complex their environments were. These experiences pushed me to get my B.S. in General Biology and B.A. in Environmental Policy at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). I studied several different species-environment interactions, including copepods and copper toxicity at the Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies, marsh plants species and increased carbon inputs at the Smithsonian Institute for Environmental Studies and limpet-surfgrass interactions under acidified conditions at UCSD. At the Roberts Lab, I study how climate change is going to affect the organisms in our current and future oceans. My current projects involve examining ocean acidification's effects oysters using "-omic" techniques. 

I'm also interested in projects at the intersection of science, policy and communication! I currently serve as the Social Media Intern at the NOAA Office of National Marine Sanctuaries, where I spearheaded a profile series featuring graduate students in the Dr. Nancy Foster Scholarship Program. I interned at the Tropical Forest Group and served on the editorial board of the undergraduate biology research journal, Saltman Quarterly. I have also participated in several education and outreach experiences through the Monterey Bay Aquarium, where I assisted with developing a teen social media brand and was a part of the aquarium's youth delegation for the 2012 International Aquarium Congress.
