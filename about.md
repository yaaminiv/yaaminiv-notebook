## About

The Lab Notebook of Yaamini Venkataraman, a graduate student in the Roberts Lab at the University of Washington, Seattle.

I'm primarily interested in how climate change is going to affect the organisms in our current and future oceans. I currently study how ocean acidification affects oysters using "-omic" techniques. I'm also interested in projects at the intersection of science, policy and communication!

## Abridged CV

### Research experience

**Undergraduate Researcher**: Taylor Lab, Scripps Institution of Oceanography (September 2015-June 2016)
