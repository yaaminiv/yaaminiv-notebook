## The Lab Notebook of Dr. Yaamini R. Venkataraman, a Postdoctoral Scholar and NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Biology (NSF PRFB) at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.

*The short version:*

I'm interested in how climate change is going to affect the organisms in our current and future oceans. I integrate -omics and whole-organism physiology techniques to investigate phenotypic plasticity’s role in marine invertebrate responses to climate change, specifically using sub- and nonlethal stressors. My Ph.D work used oysters as models to understand methylation responses to ocean acidification. Currently, I study how hypoxia impacts Caribbean corals and killifish, and how temperature influences crab metabolism using "-omic" techniques.

*The long version:*

Originally from the California Bay Area, I grew up going to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. I was always floored by the intricacies of the organisms themselves, but also how complex their environments were. These experiences pushed me to get my B.S. in General Biology and B.A. in Environmental Policy at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). I studied several different species-environment interactions, including copepods and copper toxicity at the Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies, marsh plants species and increased carbon inputs at the Smithsonian Institute for Environmental Studies and limpet-surfgrass interactions under acidified conditions at UCSD.

For my Ph.D at the Roberts Lab, I studied ocean acidification's effects on Pacific and Eastern oysters using epigenomic techniques. In addition to being the first to describe pH-sensitive methylation in oysters, my work furthered the use of oysters and models by highlighting tissue- and species-specificity. I am continuing this work by elucidating connections between genetic variation, DNA methylation, gene expression, and non-coding RNA in low pH conditions to understand how methylation may interact with other mechanisms to regulate gene expression and physiological phenotype. This information will be applied towards understanding intergenerational plasticity.

For my postdoctoral work at WHOI, I use Atlantic killifish, Caribbean corals, and European green crabs as focal species to understand responses to hypoxia and temperature at the whole-organism and molecular levels.

I'm also interested in projects at the intersection of science, policy, communication, and equity! I co-developed and taught a graduate seminar about settler-colonialism and white supremacy in aquatic and fishery sciences. I helped create a professional development certificate program to not only provide institutional recognition for JEDI, outreach, mentorship, and leadership work, but to also create structured training for these valuable transferable skills. By spearheading town hall discussions and demand letters as a graduate student leader, I pushed our department to create a code of conduct and pursue a racial equity audit. I currently advocate for postdoctoral researchers across WHOI Postdoctoral Association representative. After learning that postdoc mentoring needs are often unmet at WHOI, I revived a peer mentoring program for incoming postdocs. I co-founded my graduate department’s outreach organization to provide marine science lessons to K-12 students in under-resourced Seattle schools and build connections with local communities. I work with similar groups at WHOI, including the Broader Impacts Group and Undergraduate Recruitment Working Group. In graduate school, I served on the Engage Science Board of Directors and ComSciCon-PNW board, which are both student-led science communication initiatives. I was a as the Social Media Intern at the NOAA Office of National Marine Sanctuaries, where I spearheaded a profile series featuring graduate students in the Dr. Nancy Foster Scholarship Program.
